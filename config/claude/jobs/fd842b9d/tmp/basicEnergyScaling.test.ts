// 0.391.0 → 0.392.0 — **THE PRINTED CARD CATEGORY `Basic`, AND IT IS `Special`'s
// COMPLEMENT RATHER THAN A TENTH ENERGY TYPE (D500).**
//
//   `censusAttackCorpus.ts` FILE LINE 580
//   "This attack does 40 damage for each Basic Energy attached to this Pokémon."
//   1 sentence / 1 Standard-legal printing, the `×` fold.
//
// 🛑 **THE WHOLE BUILD IS ONE ROW IN `CLAUSE_ENERGY_TOKENS`.** The anchor
// (`SELF_ENERGY_MULTIPLY`) has admitted the token since the day it was written — its
// filter group is `(?:(.+) )?` and `Basic` matches it — and the sentence was refused
// one step LATER, by `attachedEnergyFilter` answering `undefined` for a token the map
// had no key for. `selfEnergyScaling.test.ts`'s D459 rung had said exactly that
// (*"the ANCHOR admits both and `attachedEnergyFilter` is what tells them apart"*) and
// nobody had priced it.
//
// ⚠️ **THE RECORDED REFUSAL NAMED A CARRIER AND THE CARRIER WAS WRONG (D457/D499).**
// Two doc blocks in `effects.ts` and a rung in `benchBodyScaling.test.ts` said this
// sentence *"asks a question `countEnergyInPlay` does not answer"*. Both halves fail:
//   · `countEnergyInPlay` has answered a card-CATEGORY question since D159 —
//     `"special"` is one, read off `isSpecialEnergy` rather than through provision —
//     so the category was never outside its vocabulary; and
//   · this sentence never reaches `countEnergyInPlay` at all. *"attached to this
//     Pokémon"* is the ZONE-LESS path and delegates to `countAttachedEnergy`.
// The refusal was REASON-ONLY wrong (D479's third class) and the verdict it produced
// — "unbuilt" — was true; what it cost was that nobody re-derived the price for 300+
// decisions, which is D478's loop exactly (a refusal stops a family being built, an
// unbuilt family attracts no rows, and no rows means nothing re-derives the refusal).
//
// 🛑 **IT IS A CARDS QUESTION AND NOT A PROVISION QUESTION, AND §2 IS WHERE THAT IS
// DRIVEN.** A Special Energy may PROVIDE a basic type — `fix-blend`'s registry
// `EnergyProgram` provides `["Fire", "Water"]` — so *"each Basic Energy attached"* and
// *"each {W} Energy attached"* count DIFFERENT CARDS on one board. The new arm asks
// `matchesFilter`'s shipped `basicEnergy` predicate (`card.energyType === "Normal"`),
// which is the same predicate the DISCARD-PILE reader already resolves this printed
// noun to — one noun, one answer (D159) — reached through a different vocabulary
// because an attached count is narrowed by an energy token and a pile count by a
// `CardFilter`.
//
// THE AXIS LATTICE, run over all 13 `deriveAttack*` exports before anything was
// written. Four segments were counted from the PRINT — AMOUNT (`40`), FOLD
// (`damage` vs `more damage`), NOUN (`Basic`) and TAIL (`this Pokémon`) — and **three
// of the four are DEGENERATE** by D491/D494's test: each one's PRINTED value already
// builds on an otherwise-built sentence, so substituting it changes nothing. The
// honest table is 2¹ and its built-by-weight vector is **`0/1 · 1/1`**:
//
//   weight 0 (the print)              1 point,  0 built
//   weight 1 (NOUN → `{W}`)           1 point,  1 built
//
// That is a FOURTH lattice shape beside D489/D490/D494's (one built point at FULL
// weight), D495's (`0/1 · 2/2 · 0/1`, every segment built) and D499's (`0/1 · 1/3 ·
// 0/1`, the blocker is the JOIN). **One axis, and it is a single printed TOKEN** —
// which says the answer is neither an anchor nor a seam but a VOCABULARY entry, and
// is why this slice costs zero anchor bytes and zero reader bytes.
//
// WHAT MOVED, and what did not:
//   · `CLAUSE_ENERGY_TOKENS` gains ONE row, `["Basic", "basic"]`, beside `["Special",
//     "special"]`; the map's value type widens by one inhabitant.
//   · `countAttachedEnergy`, `countEnergyInPlay` and `hasAttachedEnergy` each gain ONE
//     arm, all three delegating to one new module-private `basicEnergyUids`.
//   · `conditionNote` gains ONE arm — **and `tsc` said nothing about its absence**,
//     because the branch it would have fallen into is a TEMPLATE STRING (§4).
//   · **ZERO** new anchors, readers (surface unmoved at **13**), ops, op fields,
//     `DamageCountSource` members, `CardFilter` members, prompts, events, error codes,
//     registry rows, `FIXTURE_POOL` ids, `packages/schema` bytes, `redact.ts` bytes or
//     UI bytes.
//   · **`MATCH_RECORD_VERSION` STAYS 29**, and the address is named before the
//     argument (§7).

      · `fix-energy` — a BASIC Energy whose name does not parse, so it provides only
        `Colorless`. It is what separates *"is a Basic Energy card"* from *"provides a
        basic type"* in the direction where the naive reading counts too FEW.
      · 🛑 `fix-blend` — a SPECIAL Energy whose registry `EnergyProgram` provides
        `["Fire", "Water"]`. It is the one card in the pool that separates the two
        readings in the direction where the naive reading counts too MANY, and it is
        the whole reason this file exists rather than three more rungs next door.
      · `fix-special` — a SPECIAL Energy with no program, so `Colorless` only. The
        control for `fix-blend`: same card class, no basic provision.
      · `fix-titan` — 340 HP, no Weakness and no Resistance, so every number below is
