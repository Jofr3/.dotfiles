// 0.383.0 → 0.384.0 — 🆕🆕🆕 D489: THE HAND DISCARD WHOSE COUNT IS THE SNIPE'S MULTIPLIER.
//
//   file line 138 (2 printings)  "Discard up to 3 Energy cards from your hand. This
//                                 attack does 60 damage to 1 of your opponent's Pokémon
//                                 for each Energy card you discarded in this way.
//                                 (Don't apply Weakness and Resistance for Benched

//
// 1 sentence / 2 legal printings over `legalAttackCorpus()`'s 640 / 1,732. The carrier
// ids are UNRESOLVED in this checkout (no local D1) and are stated as such rather than
// invented — D425's standing limitation.
//
// 🛑 **THE FIRST DELIVERABLE WAS AN AXIS DELETION, AND IT PRICED THE SLICE AT FIVE AXES
// RATHER THAN ONE.** §2 runs the whole 2⁵ lattice — the SOURCE ZONE, the CHOSEN target,
// the SCALING tail, the count NOUN and the W/R clarifier, each substituted onto its
// nearest BUILT spelling — against all 13 `deriveAttack*` exports of
// `attackReaderSurface()`. **Exactly ONE of the 32 points builds: the all-five
// substitution.** No single, pair, triple or quadruple deletion reaches a claimed
// string, so **no half of this sentence already shipped** — which is the opposite of
// what the neighbouring built rows suggest, and the opposite of the handoff's read.
//
// 🛑 **THE HEAD IS `payFromHand` AND NOT A SEVENTH `discardEnergy.from` MEMBER.** All
// six `from` members are BOARD scopes — that op's own doc block calls them *"a spot, a
// side, a body and the side MINUS the spot"* — and every machine under them takes a
// `PokemonRef`: `discardableEnergies` yields `{uid, from: PokemonRef}`, the §11 shield
// filters those refs, `interchangeableCandidates` keys on the body, and the
// `discardEnergy` PARK carries the refs across the wire. A hand card has no ref, so a
// hand member would have changed the PROMPT's candidate shape (D457's five mirrors:
// `packages/schema`, `redact.ts`, `projection.ts` and both HUDs) in order to say what
// the `chooseCards` prompt already says. What `payFromHand` lacked was the printed
// QUANTIFIER, and that is `discardEnergy.count`'s own D361 widening at the sibling op:
// *a WIDENING is free; a GENERALISATION is not.*
//
// 🛑 **`snipeAmount` COULD ALREADY REACH A §9.2 SLOT AND NOBODY HAD ASKED.** The fold
// has been a second, parallel one since Covetous Ivy (D448); `record` was in scope at
// BOTH its call sites (`stepOp` takes it as a parameter, `applyChoice` takes it as a
// parameter), so the third rider cost a fourth argument and four lines rather than a
// channel. The refusal this overturns — *"there is no state field, no `EffectSlot` and
// no `EffectContext` key that carries how many cards the previous op moved"* — was
// right about `state` and `EffectContext` and wrong about the engine (D456's rule: a
// refusal's scope is the carrier it was measured on).
//
// 🛑 **AND THE D420 STRUCTURAL GUARD GAINS A THIRD NAMED ESCAPE.** An attack-borne
// `payFromHand` owes a printed cancel (D420) or a §9.2 gate on its own slot (D473).
// This sentence prints neither and is honest because **a DECLINABLE payment cannot be
// short** AND its consequent is a MULTIPLE of what it paid. Neither fact alone is
// enough — *"Discard up to 3 cards from your hand. Knock Out your opponent's Active
// Pokémon."* is declinable and would be a free Knock Out — and
// `handEnergyCancel.test.ts` §5 drives that near-miss.
//
// ⚠️ **WHAT THIS SLICE COST, NAMED AS ZEROES SO THE CLAIM IS CHECKABLE:** ONE new
// anchor, ONE new `deriveAttackEffect` arm, ONE new UNION ARM on a shipped op and ONE
// OPTIONAL key on a shipped op. **ZERO** new `EffectOp` KINDS, `EffectSlot` members,
// `CardFilter`/`DamageCountSource`/`BoardCondition` members, prompts, prompt fields,
// choice kinds, events, error codes, `GameState`/`InPlayPokemon` fields, readers (the
// surface stands still at **13**), registry rows, `FIXTURE_POOL` ids (file-local
// `cardPool`, D414), `redact.ts` bytes, `packages/schema` bytes and
// **`MATCH_RECORD_VERSION` bytes**.
//
// SEED-FREE: neither op consumes RNG. The one seed below feeds setup's shuffle, and
// every board rebuilds the zones under test outright.
