// D511 — THE MUTATION HARNESS REJECTS A COMMAND LINE IT DOES NOT UNDERSTAND,
// AND THE REJECTION HAPPENS BEFORE ANYTHING READS OR WRITES A BYTE.
//
// THE DEFECT, MEASURED AT D510 RATHER THAN IMAGINED. `run.ts` parsed argv with
// `argv.includes(…)` and `argv.indexOf(…) + 1`, so an argument it did not
// recognise was not an error — it was invisible. Two paths, one consequence:
//
//   PATH 1 — `--id <row>` sets neither `only` nor `decision`. Both stay
//   `undefined`, `undefined` is spelled "no filter" in the selector, and the
//   "probe" is a ~3-hour sweep of all 2,541 rows wearing a one-row probe's first
//   ten seconds of output. D510 typed it THREE TIMES; two ran concurrently, were
//   killed on a timeout, and left FOURTEEN mutant patches across five source
//   files, three of them files the slice was editing.
//
//   PATH 2 — a TRAILING `--only` (or `--decision`) makes `flagValue` return
//   `argv[index + 1]` = `undefined`, which reads as "no filter" and runs the same
//   whole corpus. And `--only --full` takes the literal `"--full"` as the row id,
//   selects nothing and exits 2 — loud, but about the wrong thing.
//
// 🛑 WHY THIS IS WORSE THAN A WASTED AFTERNOON: `bun run check` WAS GREEN on one
// of D510's patched trees. A mutant is by construction a plausible edit — it
// compiles, it lints, and the suite that would kill it has already been restored
// out from under it. So a mistyped flag reaches a state that looks healthy to the
// repo's own gate and silently corrupts whatever is committed next.
//
// 🛑 SO WHAT GOES RED HERE, STATED FIRST (D200 → D214's rule — a check whose
// author cannot name the edit that breaks it is vacuous):
//
//   (1) delete a rule from `argvProblems` — stop rejecting unknown flags, or stop
//       rejecting a missing value, or stop rejecting a positional → the matching
//       REJECTS case fails, naming the line that was about to be accepted;
//   (2) widen a rule so a LEGITIMATE line is refused (reject every `-`-prefixed
//       value, reject a repeated boolean's first occurrence, reject `--list`
//       beside `--decision`) → the ACCEPTS case fails. Both directions, because a
//       guard that only fails one way is a guard you disable by over-firing it;
//   (3) 🛑 MOVE THE CALL IN `run.ts` — put `argvProblems(argv)` after the `--list`
//       branch, or after `recoverFromJournal()`, or delete the call entirely →
//       the WIRING case fails. This is the case the file exists for and the one a
//       pure unit test cannot make: the validator can be perfect and unreachable.
//       D369 paid for exactly this ordering once already, from the other side;
//   (4) add a flag to `run.ts` (`argv.includes("--dry-run")`) without registering
//       it in `argv.ts`, or register one here that the harness never reads → the
//       SURFACE case fails. The expected set is DERIVED FROM `run.ts`'s OWN TEXT
//       at test time (D504's rule: a guard over a quoted thing must assert against
//       the quoted THING), so there is no second copy of the flag list to drift;
//   (5) change the exit path from `process.exit(4)` to a `return`, or to `exit(0)`
//       → the WIRING case fails, because a rejection a caller reads as success is
//       not a rejection;
//   (6) 🛑 "FIX" `--decision`'s SUBSTRING MATCH into an exact one → the SUBSTRING
//       case fails, naming the corpus rows it would have silently orphaned.
//
// ⚠️ AND THE HONEST LIMIT, NAMED SO A GREEN RUN IS NOT OVER-READ. This suite
// DRIVES the validator and READS the wiring; it does not SPAWN `run.ts`. It
// cannot: `run.ts` has a top-level `await main()`, so importing it would run the
// mutation harness inside vitest, and this package sets `"types": []` so
// `node:child_process` does not even typecheck here. What is proved is that the
// predicate is right and that the call sits ahead of both writes in the source
// text. What is NOT proved by this file is that the assembled process exits 4 —
// that was demonstrated by hand at D511 (`bun scripts/mutation/run.ts --id
// something` → exit 4, immediately) and is pinned here only as source text.

/** `run.ts` as text. A GLOB rather than `node:fs` for `progressLog.test.ts`'s
