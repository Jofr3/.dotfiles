      names the body the sentence ACTS ON, and on every card that carries it the
      two are on OPPOSITE SEATS. `seat` is the third: the controller of the
      effect, which for a watched trigger is the seat that did NOT act. A build
      that folded any two of the three together is green on a self-targeting card
      and wrong on every card in this family.

      Plain JSON and constant for the whole run, like `seat` and `sourceUid`, so
      it rides `EffectContinuation` across a park unchanged — no representative
      parks today (a fixed counter placement), but the field costs nothing to
      carry and an older continuation simply lacks it. */

  /** §11/§15.B — WHAT invoked this program, when the answer changes a RULE.
      Set to `"attack"` by attack.ts and by nothing else; ABSENT everywhere else
      (a Trainer, an activated Ability, a trigger, the Checkup), which is why it
      is optional rather than a two-member union with a default: the fact is
      "this is an attack's effect", and its negation needs no spelling.

      ⚠️ THIS REFINES D139's RULE RATHER THAN REVERSING IT, and the distinction is
      worth stating because that decision explicitly declined a context field.
      D139 was choosing where a LOG LABEL for ONE op should live and answered "on
      the op" — `damageActive`/`damageChosen` carry `source: "ability" | "attack"`
      to this day, and they still should, because a label is a property of the row
      that op emits. What rides HERE is a RULE that SEVERAL ops must answer
      IDENTICALLY: "prevent all damage from and effects of ATTACKS done to this
      Pokémon" (D142) asks every defender-relative op the same question, and the
      only site that knows the answer is the one that started the program. Written
      per op it would be one fact in six places with six chances to go stale;
      written here it is stated once by the caller that knows.

      D139's second objection — that `ctx` is serialized into every park — is
      answered by the field being exactly what a park NEEDS: an attack effect that
      parks and resolves three actions later is still an attack's effect, and the
      continuation carries that across the wire for free. An old continuation
      written before this field simply lacks it, which reads as "not an attack" and
      is byte-identical to the pre-slice behaviour.

      It is NOT the same axis as `sourceUid` even though both describe the
      invocation: that one names WHICH BODY the effect belongs to (a target
      question), this one names WHAT KIND OF THING is doing it (a rules question).

      🆕 D259 — AND IT IS NOW A THREE-MEMBER UNION, WHICH IS THE CHEAPEST OF THE
      TWO OUTCOMES THE HANDOFF PRICED. The TRAINER-borne shields (Fraxure /
      Cetitan ex / Rhyperior) ask the same question one rung wider — *"what kind of
      thing is doing this"* — and the answer for a Trainer has to distinguish an
      Item from a Supporter, because Rhyperior's sentence prints only the latter.
      So the field carries the trainer's printed TYPE rather than a bare
      `"trainer"`, and `effectRefused` reads it directly instead of re-deriving the
      played card's type from a uid that has already left the hand.

      ⚠️ WIDENING A STRING-LITERAL UNION IS BACKWARD-COMPATIBLE FOR AN OLD PARKED
      CONTINUATION, which is why `MATCH_RECORD_VERSION` does not move: a record
      written before this slice carries `invokedBy: "attack"` or nothing at all,
      and both still parse and still mean what they meant. Driven as a REPLAY in
      preventBlock.test.ts rather than asserted (D258's rule).

      It is set by `attack.ts` (as `"attack"`) and by cardplay.ts's ONE trainer
      `runProgram` call (as the played card's `trainerType`), and by nothing else —
      an Ability's program leaves it absent, which is why an Ability that discards
      an opposing Energy is refused by neither channel. */
  invokedBy?: "attack" | "item" | "supporter";
  /** 🆕🆕 **D427 — THE DAMAGE THIS ATTACK JUST DEALT TO THE DEFENDING ACTIVE**, the
      printed *"the same amount of damage you did to your opponent's Active
      Pokémon."* (6 legal printings on 1 sentence). Set by `attack.ts` at the ONE
      `runProgram` call that has an §8.5 pipeline behind it — the same call, the same
      argument, that sets `invokedBy: "attack"` — and ABSENT everywhere else (a
      Trainer, an Ability, a trigger, the Checkup), none of which has done any damage
      to read.

      🛑 **WHY `EffectContext` AND NOT `EffectRecord`, AND THE FIRST REASON IS THE
      VALUE TYPE RATHER THAN THE MEANING.** `EffectRecord` is
      `{ [K in EffectSlot]?: string[] }` and `EffectSlot` is
      `"paid" | "moved" | "discarded"` — **every §9.2 slot in this engine is a LIST
      OF CARD UIDS**, and this is an HP FIGURE. There is no slot to file it in and no
      widening that keeps the map's value type, so the record could only carry it by
      becoming a different kind of thing. D406 priced this sentence and named exactly
      that, one slice before declining it.

      ⚠️ **AND THE MEANING AGREES, WHICH IS THE SECOND REASON AND NOT THE FIRST.**
      `EffectRecord`'s own doc block says it is *"what the ops ALREADY RUN in this
      program left behind for the ops still to come"* — an accumulator that changes at
      nearly every op. This value is computed by §8.5 **before the program's first op
      runs**, is fixed for the whole run, and is read rather than written by every op
      in it. That is `seat`'s and `sourceUid`'s shape, not `record`'s. Filing it in
      the record would also have made it mutable mid-run by any recording op, which is
      a lie about a number the card fixes at the moment the damage lands.

      🛑 **BOTH CANDIDATES ARE PERSISTED, SO THE VERSION QUESTION IS NOT SETTLED BY
      PICKING THE OTHER ONE — IT IS SETTLED BY THE FIELD BEING OPTIONAL.** `ctx` rides
      `EffectContinuation` into `phase.cont`, exactly as `record` does, so a program
      that PARKS writes this key into a persisted `MatchRecord`. `MATCH_RECORD_VERSION`
      **STAYS 26** on D125's distinction: an OPTIONAL key is a WIDENING — a
      continuation written by an earlier deploy simply lacks it, which reads as
      `undefined` — where a REQUIRED key would be a missing field and would bump.
      `invokedBy` is the precedent verbatim (`apps/api/src/lobby/match.ts`: *"an
      OPTIONAL field and therefore a WIDENING… it would not have bumped anything on
      its own"*), and D412's 25 → 26 is the counter-case: a REQUIRED
      `InPlayPokemon.retreatLockedTurn`.

      ⚠️ **LOSING THE KEY WOULD DEGRADE INTO A SILENT WHIFF, WHICH IS THE SHAPE D421
      WARNS ABOUT — SO SAY WHY IT IS UNREACHABLE RATHER THAN CLAIM IT IS LOUD.** The
      only op that reads this is `{ op: "heal", target: "self", amount: "dealt" }`, and
      the only producer of THAT is `deriveAttackEffect`'s D427 arm. No deploy before
      this one could author the op, so no pre-D427 continuation can hold a reader for
      a key it also lacks: the absent-key path is uninhabited by construction rather
      than merely unlikely. What IS checkable is the pairing — `attack.ts` sets this
      field and `invokedBy: "attack"` in the same object literal, so
      `invokedBy === "attack"` ⟺ `dealt !== undefined` on every continuation this
      engine writes, and `selfHealDealt.test.ts` drives that across a real park.

      ⚠️ **ALWAYS A NUMBER FROM `attack.ts`, INCLUDING ZERO.** `attack.ts` declares it
      at function scope initialised to 0 and assigns the §8.5 `dealt` inside the damage
      block, so a prevented hit, a whiffed (damage-less) attack and an attack whose
      damage step never ran all arrive as an explicit `0` rather than as an absent key.
      The optionality is for the OTHER `runProgram` callers, which have no damage to
      report at all — it is not a "sometimes attack.ts forgets" hedge. */

        • **`min: 0`** — the printed "up to", every pile-scanning op (searchDeck

          hand/deck; the unridden lookAtTopN takes from the deck top). Taking none
          is a legal answer.
        • **`min === max`** — a MANDATORY exact pick, where the only decision is
          WHICH cards and never whether, so there is no decline. THREE producers:
          the printed hand COST (`payFromHand`, dest `"discard"` or `"deck"`), the

      `bottomFromOpponentHand` are gated upstream on a hand that holds the cards, so

      `candidates.length` at the park. `max` never needed this — a ceiling above the

          parks this dest resolves the target from `ctx.sourceUid` on the way back
          in, so a second copy on the wire could only ever disagree.
          🆕 ⚠️ **D308/D309 — "FROM `ctx.sourceUid`" IS NOW "FROM THE OP", AND THE

          🛑 **IT IS A PROMPT FIELD AND NOT AN OP FIELD, WHICH IS THE WHOLE COST OF
          THE DRAYTON ROW.** `validateChoice` (cardplay.ts) matches a wire answer
          against the PROMPT and nothing else — that is the architecture, and it is
          what a P4 client is checked by. A cap that lived only on the op would be
          invisible there, so a crafted frame could take two Pokémon out of a
          window whose printed sentence promised one of each. The op field and this
          one are two halves of one narrowing and neither is useful alone.

      take none — and the printed sentences that were still over-resolved differ
      from it by a NUMBER and nothing else. Keeping both would have put two keys
      on one axis, which is the exact refusal D358 made at the OP when it declined
      `upTo` beside `count`. **This file had already written the rule down one
      member below**: *"A prompt with `min: 0` is declinable by construction and
      does not set it."* A floor of zero subsumes a decline flag; so does a
      ceiling that admits zero.

      • **absent** — the MANDATORY exactly-one every park here meant before D358:
        switchActive, gust, returnBenched, healChosen's single arm, the two
        counter moves and both evolve-body continuations. Forced at one candidate
        (the M1 no-choice rule), and a ref-less answer is refused by the validator.
      • **`upTo: 1`** — D358's decline, respelled. `attachEnergyFrom.declinable`

      short deck can make a floor unanswerable; a ceiling above what is available
      simply never binds, and the apply has resolved `min(count, available)` since
      D205. ⚠️ **THE FIRST REASON WRITTEN HERE WAS THAT A CLAMP WOULD LEAK THE
      HAND, AND THAT WAS MEASURED FALSE**: `redactPhase` sends an `effect:choose`
      prompt ONLY to the seat that must answer it, so no field on this prompt
      reaches the other side at all. The reason that survives is internal
      consistency — the park's `note` quotes the PRINTED count verbatim (D205,
      because the count is the one thing a player cannot read off the offered
      rows), so a ceiling cut to "what you actually hold" would offer one button
      under a caption promising two: **one prompt contradicting itself**.

      🛑 **AND IT CHANGES WHAT `parkOrForce` DOES AT **ONE** CANDIDATE**, which
      is the half a reader will not guess from the field alone — D358's finding,
      inherited verbatim and now reaching further. The M1 no-choice rule forces a
      lone candidate because a question with one answer is not a question. A pick
      with a ceiling has `upTo + 1` answers over one candidate, so it parks at
      every non-empty candidate set. **This is D47's call, verbatim**, made for
      `choosePokemonMulti` and reversed there in review: honouring the right only
      above the auto-resolve threshold honours it *"exactly where declining
      matters least"*. ⚠️ **THIS IS WHAT FINALLY REACHES THE `toSelf` FAMILIES.**
      Bloodmoon Ursaluna, Lycanroc, Regirock ex and Kilowattrel ex all print
      *"up to 2 … to **this Pokémon**"*: one candidate by construction, so before
      this slice the controller was never asked at all and always attached two.

      🛑 **`MATCH_RECORD_VERSION` MOVES 21 → 22 AND THAT IS THE COST OF THE
      RENAME**, asked rather than assumed. This prompt rides the persisted
      `effect:choose` phase. D358's `declinable` was a WIDENING — absent read as
      mandatory, which is what older records meant — and cost no bump. A RENAME is
      not a widening: a v21 record carries `declinable: true` over a park this
      build would read as `upTo === undefined`, i.e. MANDATORY, and a resumed
      match would refuse a decline the player was promised. D352 made exactly this
      call one op over (`attachFromTop.discardRest` → `restTo`). */

      that the answer is a SET, dispatched in one go.

      The printed number is EXACT unless the card says "up to" (§9.1): the

      Declinable (pick none).

      🆕🆕 **D443 — THE REFS CAN NOW BE THE OPPONENT'S, AND THIS PROMPT NEEDED NO
      FIELD TO SAY SO.** Every `PokemonRef` here carries its own ABSOLUTE `seat`
      (the wire twin says so in as many words: *"its `seat` is ABSOLUTE (p1/p2), NOT
      viewer-relative … the client resolves a ref to a board Pokémon by comparing
      `ref.seat` to that own seat"*), so the two opponent-board printings park on a
      prompt whose bytes differ from an own-board one only in the seats already
      inside the refs. That is why `side` rides the OP and NOT the prompt where
      `anySource` and `anyDest` ride both: those two are COUPLINGS, invisible in
      the candidate lists, and this one is spelled by every candidate.

      ⚠️ **NO `answerer`, AND THAT IS THE RULE RATHER THAN AN OMISSION.**
      `ptcg-rules.md` §9.4: *"Almost every printed effect is decided by the player
      resolving it, even when it reaches across the table … the target is theirs,
      the choice is yours. A small family inverts that, and the wording is the tell:
      'your opponent may …'."* Neither sentence prints a chooser, so the CONTROLLER
      answers — the same call `knockOutChosen` (D416) and `discardEnergy`'s
      `opponentChosen` arm already make about picks on the other seat's board.
      Nothing crosses that should not: attached Energy uids and in-play refs are
      PUBLIC on the redacted board for both seats (`redactedInPlayOf` emits
      `attached` unconditionally), which is what makes this the public-ref family.

      `anySource` (D226 — N's Plan's printed "from your Benched **Pokémon**")
      lifts the first clause of that sentence: the picks may come off SEVERAL of
      the offered sources. It is carried HERE and not only on the op because the
      wire validator, the wire schema and both HUD dialogs read the prompt and
      never the op — a coupling only the interpreter knows about is one no
      answerer can satisfy. OPTIONAL, so a park persisted by a build that predates
      it reads back as the single-source coupling it was written under
      (`MATCH_RECORD_VERSION` unmoved — a widening, not a missing field).

      🆕🆕 **D441 — `min` IS THE FLOOR, AND IT IS WHAT LETS THIS PROMPT SAY
      "MANDATORY".** Absent (or 0) is the decline this arm has carried since M4;
      `min === max` is Castform's printed *"Move **all** Energy"*, where the
      quantity is not a decision and only the destination is. It is carried HERE
      and not only on the op for `anySource`'s reason word for word — the wire
      validator, the wire schema and both HUD dialogs read the PROMPT and never
      the op — and it is a NUMBER rather than a boolean because that is this
      engine's shipped spelling for the same fact in three other places:
      `chooseCards`'s *"`min` is the DECLINABLE split (0 = the printed 'up to',
      `min === max === count` = a mandatory exact cost)"* (redacted.ts),
      `choosePokemonMulti`'s `{min, max, declinable}`, and the
      `const exact = prompt.min === prompt.max` both HUDs already caption from.

      🛑 **OPTIONAL, AND THE MISSING KEY IS NOT A LOST FACT — IT IS THE CORRECT
      READING OF THE OLD BYTES.** Every `moveEnergy` park an earlier deploy could
      author was declinable (this block's own third sentence), so `prompt.min ?? 0`
      resumes such a record meaning exactly what it meant. That is D334's optional
      `exact` verbatim, and it is the INVERSE of D359's `upTo`, which DID move
      `MATCH_RECORD_VERSION` precisely because absent came to mean MANDATORY where
      the old bytes meant declinable. **Direction is the whole of the difference**,
      and it is the discriminator that block states outright: *"does the old byte
      string still mean what it meant"*.

      🆕🆕 **D442 — `anyDest` IS THE DESTINATION-SIDE MIRROR, AND IT IS WHAT MAKES
      THIS PROMPT'S ANSWER A MAP.** Absent (every park before this deploy) the picks
      all land on ONE of the offered `destinations` and the answer's `picks` must
      agree about it — which is exactly what the old `{ uids, dest }` answer said in
      its shape. Present (the printed *"in any way you like"*) each pick names its
      OWN destination, and the only surviving rule is the per-pick one this prompt
      has enforced since D226: a pick's destination may not be the body it came off.

      It is carried HERE and not only on the op for `anySource`'s reason word for
      word, and it is OPTIONAL for `min`'s: absent means the coupling, which is what
      every older writer meant, so `MATCH_RECORD_VERSION` does not move (D334, not
      D359). ⚠️ **THE ANSWER'S RENAME COSTS NO BUMP EITHER, AND NOT BECAUSE IT IS
      ADDITIVE** — `EffectChoice` is never serialized at all: it rides one
      `resolveEffect` action and is discarded, where the PROMPT and the
      `EffectContinuation` are what `phase` persists. */

      interchangeableCandidates), and an offer no bigger than `count` auto-resolves

      goes to the controller alone, exactly like lookAtTopN's chooseCards; the
      ones actually attached become public through ENERGY_ATTACHED, and the ones
      left unattached stay unnamed unless `discardRest` puts them in the (public)
      discard pile. `targets` are the eligible own Pokémon (attachEnergyTargets,

      attached — the printed "up to 2", or the whole candidate set for "any
      number", already resolved to a number here so the dialog and the wire
      validator both read one field.

      `maxPerTarget` caps how many may land on any ONE of those targets — the
      printed "for each of those Pokémon" (Janine's Secret Art, one Energy
      apiece). Absent is the printed "in any way you like": no limit, every split
      legal including all of them on a single Pokémon. It is a separate field
      rather than a smaller `max` because the two bound different things — three
      cards spread one-per-Pokémon is `max: 3, maxPerTarget: 1`, and neither
      number can be recovered from the other.

      🆕🆕 **D457 — `oneTarget` IS THAT FIELD'S DUAL AND BOUNDS THE OTHER END OF
      THE SAME MAP**: the printed *"attach them to **1 of** your Pokémon"*, where

      cards per target; this caps the TARGETS the answer may name, at the one
      number the catalog prints (see `attachFromDeck.oneTarget` for the census
      that makes it a flag rather than a count). Absent is "in any way you like"
      again — so the two absences say the same thing from opposite ends, and a
      prompt setting BOTH would be describing `max: 1`, which no printing spells.

      prompt in this engine whose candidates are neither CARDS nor POKÉMON but
      ROWS of one Pokémon's printed attack list, which is why it carries a shape of
      its own rather than reusing `chooseCards`: an attack has no uid, and the only
      thing the answer can be is an INDEX into `attacksOf(card)` — the same value
      the `attack` action carries, the registry's `attack` map is keyed by and
      `InPlayPokemon.lockedAttack` stores.

      ⚠️ PUBLIC INFORMATION, AND THE ANSWERER GATE IS A CONVENIENCE HERE RATHER
      THAN A BARRIER — the `choosePokemon` end of the split (2b-iii-b), not the
      `chooseCards` end (2b-iii-c). Both players can read the printed attacks off a
      face-up Active, and an Active is face-up for both viewers the moment setup
      ends (redact.ts's `inSetup` gate), which an attack's tail is always after. So
      nothing here needs hiding, and `redactPrompt` resolves no card identity.

      ⚠️ IT NONETHELESS CARRIES THE `name`, WHICH THE PUBLIC-REF FAMILY DOES NOT,
      AND THE REASON IS A HOLE IN THE WIRE RATHER THAN A REVEAL. A `PokemonRef` and
      an attached-Energy uid both resolve against the redacted BOARD the client
      already holds; an attack INDEX resolves against nothing — `RedactedCard`
      carries `id`/`cardId`/`name` and no attack rows, and `RedactedAttack[]` is
      published for the viewer's OWN Active only. So the wire must carry the label
      or the dialog would offer numbered buttons. **The two axes are independent**:
      "is the answerer gate load-bearing?" and "must the wire carry a resolved
      label?" — this prompt is the first case that answers NO to the first and YES
      to the second, and saying so is cheaper than the next reader re-deriving it.

      `candidates` is never empty and never a singleton: the op resolves both
      degenerate boards inline (no attacks → silent no-op, one attack → forced),
      the M1 doctrine every parking op in this file follows. */

      itself (applyChoice draws them); this one is answered by the CONTROLLER (no

      A SIBLING OF `mayDraw` RATHER THAN A RENAME OF IT, and the three reasons are

      SITES differ: a mayDraw answer means *move `count` cards to the answerer*, a
      confirm answer means *run `then`* — one is a fact about cards, the other a
      fact about the program. (2) `count` is MEANINGLESS here: every mayDraw
      producer writes a printed number its dialog renders ("Draw 2 cards"), and a
      generic confirm has no number to write — a merged arm would carry a field
      three quarters of its parks could not fill honestly. (3) `kind` is a
      PERSISTED literal (it rides `GameState.phase.prompt` into the match record),
      so renaming it would owe a `MATCH_RECORD_VERSION` bump; adding an
      inhabitant does not.

  /** 🆕🆕 **D341 — THE FIRST PROMPT IN THIS ENGINE WHOSE ANSWER IS AN ORDER.**
      `candidates` are the looked-at cards in their CURRENT deck order, index 0 =
      the top; a legal answer is a PERMUTATION of exactly those uids, and the
      answer's array order IS the new order (index 0 becomes the new top).

      🛑 **EVERY OTHER PROMPT HERE ANSWERS WITH A SET, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS NOT
      THE SHAPE OF THE ANSWER — IT IS WHO READS THE INDICES.** `chooseCards`
      already answers with a `string[]`, and four sessions of backlog re-pricing
      (D336 a LIST of caps, D337 a flat cap over a union, D338 the same cap on an
      attack, D339 a flat cap over a union of two by-name members) each concluded
      that neither more caps nor fewer nor a different surface nor a narrower noun
      gets you an order. They were right, and the reason is one line long: every
      `chooseCards` consumer iterates the answer to MOVE cards, so two answers
      that name the same uids are the same board, and `validateChoice` is free to
      treat the array as a set. Here the array positions are the entire game
      effect. **A prompt kind is a claim about what the answer MEANS, not about
      what it is made of** — which is why this is a new kind and not a
      `chooseCards` with `min === max === candidates.length`, an answer that
      validator would have accepted while the engine ignored the order.

      **NO `min`/`max`.** The count is not a decision: the answer is a permutation
      of the whole window or it is invalid. A floor and a ceiling that are both
      pinned to `candidates.length` would be two fields that can only ever be one
      value, D135's rule.

      **NO `declinable`, and it is printed rather than assumed.** *"Put them back
      in any order"* has no *"you may"*: the player must state an order, and
      leaving the deck as it was is a legal ANSWER (the identity permutation)
      rather than a decline. The two are observably different — a decline emits no
      decision at all, where the identity permutation is a choice the player made.

      **NEVER PARKED WITH FEWER THAN 2 CANDIDATES** — one ordering, no decision,
      M1's doctrine, resolved inline by the op. Stated here because the dialogs
      may rely on it: a reorder control with one row is not a control.

      ⚠️ **THE CANDIDATES ARE HIDDEN INFORMATION AND ON THREE OF THE FOUR
      PRINTINGS THEY ARE THE *OTHER* SEAT's.** `redactPrompt` resolves candidate
      identities to the ANSWERER ALONE (`chooseCards`'s gate, transferred), and
      that is load-bearing in a way it has never been before: on the opponent-deck
      arm the seat whose deck it is must not learn its own top. What the other
      player is owed is the count-only `DECK_TOP_REORDERED` row and nothing more.

      🆕🆕 **D344 — `alt` IS A PRINTED SECOND ARM, AND IT IS THE ONLY THING THE

      caption is these words; absent = it does not, which is every park before
      this slice, byte-for-byte.

      🛑 **THE ALTERNATIVE IS ANSWERED BY THE EMPTY ORDERING**, which is a value
      this prompt could not previously hold rather than one taken away from
      something: `validateChoice` demands a permutation of a window that is never
      smaller than 2, so `[]` was always refused, and it is admitted here EXACTLY
      when `alt` is present. It also reads as the print does — *none of these
      cards is being put back on top.*

      🛑 **AND NO NEW PROMPT KIND WAS OWED, WHICH IS WHERE THIS ROW'S PRICE
      ACTUALLY WENT.** `confirm`'s own doc settles it: *"a confirm answer means run
      `then` … a fact about the program"*, so "a binary answer that picks between
      two printed arms" is a MEANING this engine already had. What no existing
      prompt could do is ask that question **with the cards visible** — a `confirm`
      park carries no candidates, and the print hands the look over BEFORE the
      `or`, so an `optional` wrapper would have made the choice BLIND. **The
      prompt that asks the `or` has to be the prompt that delivers the look**, and

      **silently** — the right board by accident, and unreadable as an intention.
      Absent-`ref` makes each of those nine sites state, in code, that a decline
      moves nothing. It also keeps the union at ten members and the wire frame of
      a decline strictly SMALLER than any existing answer, so no client that
      predates this slice can produce one by accident: they all attach a ref.

      ⚠️ **THE VALIDATOR IS WHERE THE WIDENING EARNS ITS KEEP** (D341's rule for
      `orderCards`, one member over). An absent `ref` is accepted against a
      `upTo` prompt and REFUSED with `BAD_EFFECT_CHOICE` against every
      other one — so a crafted frame cannot decline Boss's Orders' gust, which

      🆕🆕 **D359 — `take` IS THE ANSWERED QUANTITY, AND ITS ABSENCE IS THE WHOLE
      BATCH.** The printed *"attach **up to 2** … to 1 of your Benched Ethan's
      Pokémon"* asks ONE compound question — which body, and how many onto it —
      because `count` pins the batch to the one body the print NAMES. So the
      quantity rides the SAME answer as the body rather than a second prompt:
      a second prompt would contradict `count`'s own documented reading, and the
      map prompt (`attachCards`) that could ask both re-opens the distribution
      `count` exists to close.

      **ABSENT = the prompt's `upTo`**, which is why this widening breaks no
      client: every pre-D359 answer to this prompt was a bare ref, every bare ref
      still means "all of it", and the ONLY answers that are new are the middle
      ones §9.1 has always printed. Present, it must be an integer in `1..upTo`
      against a prompt that carries a ceiling.

      🛑 **`{ ref, take: 0 }` IS REFUSED, AND THAT IS A RULE RATHER THAN A
      TYPO-CATCHER.** A named body with nothing attached to it is the DECLINE,
      which this union already spells as the absent ref. Two spellings of one
      answer is how a log ends up with a row that names a Pokémon nothing
      happened to, and how a §9.2 `recordGate` reading "if you attached Energy in
      this way" ends up with a body and no uids. One answer, one spelling. */

      uid offered and taken once, every destination offered, no pick landing on the
      body it came off, and — unless the prompt carries `anySource` / `anyDest` —
      one source and one destination across the whole answer). An empty `picks` is
      a decline, refused when the prompt carries a `min`.

      🆕🆕 **D442 — A MAP WHERE THIS WAS `{ uids: string[]; dest: PokemonRef }`,
      AND IT IS A RENAME RATHER THAN AN ADDITIVE `picks?:` BESIDE THE PAIR.** The
      printed *"in any way you like"* (3 sentences / 3 legal printings) needs each
      pick to name its own destination, which is `attachCards`'s shipped
      `assignments` shape — the one this file's `attachCards` doc has cited as the
      difference since D335 (*"each attached card names its OWN destination — so the
      answer is a MAP (card → Pokémon), not a list … moveEnergy's picks share one
      destination"*).

      🛑 **THE OPTIONAL ROAD WAS AVAILABLE AND IS REFUSED ON D359's OWN RULE, ONE
      MEMBER UP.** `{ uids: [a, b], dest: X }` and `{ picks: [{a, X}, {b, X}] }` are
      the SAME ANSWER, so keeping both is *"two spellings of one answer"* — the
      shape `{ ref, take: 0 }` is refused for four lines above, and for the same
      consequence: two spellings mean two apply paths, and a log row can then name a
      Pokémon by one route that the other route never named. One answer, one
      spelling.

      ⚠️ **AND THE RENAME IS FREE OF `MATCH_RECORD_VERSION`, WHICH IS A FACT ABOUT
      THIS TYPE AND NOT A JUDGEMENT ABOUT THE CHANGE.** Nothing persists an
      `EffectChoice`: a `MatchRecord` holds `{version, seed, startedAt, state, log,
      names}`, `state.phase` holds the PROMPT and the `EffectContinuation`
      (`{pendingOp, rest, ctx, record?}`), and `log` is the rendered
      `SeatLogEntry[]`. A choice rides one action, is validated, is applied, and is
      gone. What a v29 record CAN hold is a parked `moveEnergy` prompt, and that
      prompt's new key is optional with the old reading as its absent arm.

      ⚠️ **THE DECLINE LOSES ITS INVENTED DESTINATION, WHICH IS THE OTHER HALF OF
      WHY THE RENAME IS THE HONEST SHAPE.** Under `{ uids, dest }` both HUDs had to
      pull an arbitrary ref off `prompt.destinations[0]` to spell "Move none" — a

    ⚠️ **IT TESTS THE ZONE AND NOT THE SEAT, AND THE SEAT TEST WAS REMOVED RATHER

    here the second one was worse than redundant — it was MASKING a mutant. With a
    seat test in place, `continuationOps`' own `fromBench === undefined` guard
    could be deleted and nothing failed, because the destination answer (an
    OPPONENT ref) fell out of this function anyway. Two guards each covering for
    the other's absence is two lines neither of which can be proved. The state
    test in `continuationOps` is the meaningful one — *only the FIRST answer buys
    a continuation* — so it stays and this one goes; the seat is guaranteed
    downstream regardless, since the mover reads `state.players[ctx.seat].bench`.
    The `spot` test survives because TypeScript needs the narrowing — a
    `PokemonRef`'s spot is a union — and because a non-bench ref degrades to NO
    continuation, the silent ending an empty Bench already takes. ⚠️ It is itself
    an EQUIVALENT MUTANT and recorded as one: `ownBenchRefs` yields bench refs
    only, and `validateChoice` matches a wire answer against the PROMPT, so no
    authored row reaches the other arm. It cannot be deleted (the narrowing is
    load-bearing), which is why it is recorded rather than removed. */

    the prompt was built from `ownInPlayRefs`, and a second copy of that rule here
    would be the mutant-masking pair D216 deleted rather than a belt.

    ⚠️ **`schedule` — D216'S SEAM, AND IT IS THE FORCED-PATH TWIN OF D186's
    SPLICE** (named `schedule` rather than `then`, which biome bans on an object
    literal — a thenable-shaped result returned into an `await` is exactly the
    confusion the rule exists to stop, and the gates' own `op.then` is a field of
    a typed union rather than a returned bag).
    A synchronous step may also schedule further ops, which `runProgram` unshifts
    onto its queue exactly as the three gates unshift `op.then`. It exists because
    a two-question printed sentence has TWO endings on its first question — the
    parked one, where `resumeProgram` can splice (D186's `optional`), and the
    FORCED one (`parkOrForce` at a single candidate), where nothing could: the
    auto-resolve path calls a helper returning a bare `GameState`, so an answer it
    computed had nowhere to go. Both endings now hand the same rewritten op to the
    same queue, which is what makes the forced and parked resolutions of one

    so a byte-identical copy would ALSO have broken a shipped mutation row into a `2×`
    ERROR without anybody touching it. The lines were MOVED here and four `D376-*` rows
    were re-transcribed onto their new addresses in the same edit — the indentation
    changed, so `precheck` would have caught it either way, which is exactly the point
    of the exactly-once rule.

    ⚠️ ~~**THE `hand` TWIN ONE ARM DOWN IS DELIBERATELY LEFT INLINE.**~~ D420's
    `yourBasicEnergyInHandAtLeast` runs the identical shape over `hand`, and its own
    doc block explains that its locals are named `handFilter`/`held` precisely to keep
    five `D376-*` `find` strings unique. Folding it in would mean a `zone` parameter and
    a rewrite of a shipped arm for a family this slice does not print — so it is not
    done, and it is recorded here rather than left as an inconsistency a successor has
    to rediscover. **The two zones are different zones**; this is not a second answer to
    one question.

    🆕🆕 **D445 — THE DEFERRAL ABOVE HAS EXPIRED, AND IT EXPIRED EXACTLY WHERE IT SAID IT
    WOULD.** Its condition was *"a family this slice does not print"*;
    `DamageCountSource.cardsInOpponentHand` prints it (2 sentences / 4 legal printings),
    so the hand loop moved out to `countCardsInHand` DIRECTLY BELOW and D420's arm is now
    a delegation. ⚠️ **AND THE `zone` PARAMETER THIS BLOCK PRICED WAS STILL REFUSED**: two
    sibling functions, not one with a discriminator, because the `find`-uniqueness the
    paragraph above is about is exactly what a shared body would destroy — the two walks
    differ in a zone name and a counter name, and both differences are load-bearing for
    six shipped mutation rows. **The refusal was right about its price and right about its

    on its own side by answering `false` for that filter unconditionally.

    ⚠️ `cardOfUid` returns `undefined` for a uid the catalog cannot resolve and

    `DamageCountSource.cardsInOpponentHand` (D445, the COUNT itself).

    🛑 **THE SIBLING ONE FUNCTION UP RECORDED THIS AS DEFERRED RATHER THAN AS AN
    INCONSISTENCY, AND THE CONDITION IT NAMED HAS ARRIVED.** `countCardsInDiscardPile`'s
    block says the hand twin is *"deliberately left inline"* because folding it in would
    cost *"a rewrite of a shipped arm for a family this slice does not print"*. D445
    prints that family (2 sentences / 4 legal printings), so the refusal expired exactly
    where it said it would — D413's rule, and the reason a refusal is written with its
    trigger rather than as a preference.

    🛑 **THE LOCALS ARE DELIBERATELY NOT THE PILE WALK'S, AND THAT IS NOT STYLE.**
    `held` where the sibling has `matched`, and `state.players[seat].hand` is the one
    other line that differs. Five `D376-discard-threshold-*` mutation rows plus
    `D440-shared-walk-reads-the-hand` carry single-line `find` strings taken off that
    function; a byte-identical mirror here would make each of them match TWICE and
    `scripts/mutation/precheck.ts` would report them BROKEN. **A MUTATION ROW'S `find`
    UNIQUENESS IS A PROPERTY THE SOURCE OWES** (D416/D437), so the duplication is
    resolved where it is created rather than by re-anchoring six rows onto longer
    context. D420 wrote that rule for the inline arm; it is carried here with the loop.

    🛑 **THE PREDICATE IS `matchesFilter`'s AND THE READING IS THE PRINT** (§6.5), and at
    this zone the reason is flatter than at the pile: a card sitting in hand is attached
    to nothing and pays for nothing, so `energyProvidesOf` has no board reading to give.
    `matchesFilter` enforces it on its own side by answering `false` for `providesEnergy`
    unconditionally.

    Rocket's Pokémon in play")? Returns the unmet condition so the §8 gate can
    name it, and `undefined` when the body may attack.

    ⚠️ **A THIRD CHANNEL AND NOT A THIRD WRITER OF `attackLockedTurn`, WHICH IS
    D240's "PRICE THE CHANNEL, NOT THE TOKEN" APPLIED TO A GATE.** `attackLocked`
    (D143) and `lockedAttackIndexes` (D154/D165) both read a turn STAMP that an
    ATTACK installed on a body; this reads the CATALOG. The three differ on every
    axis that matters:

    | | `attackLocked` | `lockedAttackIndexes` | this |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | Source  | an attack's op   | an attack's op       | a printed Ability |
    | Scope   | the whole body   | ONE attack index     | the whole body |
    | Window  | one turn (stamp) | one turn (stamp)     | ALWAYS ON |
    | Clears  | by the clock     | by the clock         | by the BOARD changing |
    | §9 lock | immune           | immune               | **SUPPRESSED** |

    The last row is the one that could not have been faked by a fourth writer of
    the stamp field: Power Saver is a printed Ability, so Klefki `sv01-096`
    "Mischievous Lock" really must silence it and let the Mewtwo attack — which
    this reader gets for free by going through `passivesOf`, the §9-suppressed
    CATALOG scan, and which a stamp on `InPlayPokemon` would have got wrong
    silently and forever.

    ⚠️ **AND IT LIVES HERE RATHER THAN IN continuous.ts BESIDE ITS TWO SIBLINGS
    BECAUSE OF THE IMPORT GRAPH, NOT BECAUSE OF THE READING.** The condition is
    seat-relative, `passivesOf` has no seat (registry.ts `attackCostDiscountPerOpponentPrize`'s
    note), and `conditionHolds` is in THIS file while interpreter.ts already
    imports continuous.ts. So the passive is COLLECTED RAW by `passivesOf` and
    EVALUATED here — `attackerPreWRBonus`'s split for `damageBonusBeforeWRIf`,
    one function family over, verbatim.

    ⚠️ **IT RETURNS THE CONDITION RATHER THAN A BOOLEAN, WHICH IS WHERE IT PARTS
    FROM `attackLocked`.** That reader returns a plain boolean because there is
    one fact and no rider (D104's minimal shape); here the fact IS the unmet
    clause, and the §8 gate's whole job is to say which one — "you need 4 or more
    Team Rocket's Pokémon in play (you have 2)" rather than "you can't attack".
    Both payability projections still only want the boolean, and take
    `!== undefined`.

    ⚠️ **THE FIRST UNMET CONDITION WINS.** `passivesOf` COLLECTS (two sources can
    name one, registry.ts's rule), and a body under two gates is barred by both —
    but a message can only name one, and naming the first in source order is
    stable. No printing in the legal pool carries two. */

    timing clause on the card itself, and if so by which clause? Returns the
    blocking gate (so the §8 reject can name the printed condition through
    `conditionNote`), or undefined when nothing on the card stops it.

      • `onlyIf`   — blocks while the condition does NOT hold (Illumise
                     `sv06-010`, Scream Tail ex `sv06-094`/`-197`).
      • `barredIf` — blocks while the condition DOES hold (Terapagos ex ×7).
      • `firstTurnExempt` — never blocks. It LIFTS §4's turn-1 ban, and it is
                     `firstTurnAttackBanned` (continuous.ts) that consumes it.

    🛑 **THE POLARITY IS RESOLVED HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE, WHICH IS THE POINT OF
    STORING IT AS A TOKEN.** Exactly one function in the repo knows that `onlyIf`
    and `barredIf` read the same condition in opposite directions; the three
    payability projections take a `!== undefined` and the §8 gate takes the note.
    That is `BoardCondition`'s standing refusal of `not` (D125) applied rather
    than re-litigated: polarity lives in the CONSEQUENT, where one reader carries
    it, instead of in the vocabulary, where every consumer would.

    ⚠️ **IT IS NOT A WIDENING OF `lockedAttackIndexes`, AND THAT WAS CHECKED
    BEFORE IT WAS WRITTEN.** That reader answers the same *shape* of question —
    "which of this body's attacks are unusable this turn" — and is the obvious
    place to put this. Three things stop it: it reads a per-turn STAMP written by
    an attack (§8/§11) where this is a CATALOG fact re-derived every read; it
    takes no SEAT and these conditions are seat-relative; and it returns a set of
    addresses with no reason, where the §8 reject must name the printed clause.
    A widened version would have had to grow a seat, a reason and a second
    lifetime — three changes to serve one call site, which is a parallel reader
    wearing the old one's name.

    ⚠️ **AND IT DOES NOT ANSWER THE §4 LICENCE**, deliberately, even though the
    licence is the same FIELD. A reader that returned "blocked / not blocked"
    for all three arms would have to know about §4's ban to say that
    `firstTurnExempt` unblocks — and §4's ban already has one reader, which every
    projection already calls. Two arms of one field, two readers, one for each
    rule they touch. */

/** §4/§10 (D278; MOVED HERE AND GIVEN A SEAT BY D279) — is `pokemon` LICENSED to
    evolve EARLY right now, i.e. are the two standing evolution-timing bans lifted
    on this body, for the player `seat`? True iff a live, unsuppressed printed
    licence is on the stack top and ITS OWN antecedent holds:

      • Eevee `sv08-143`/`sv08.5-074`/`svp-173` "Boosted Evolution" — while ACTIVE.
      • Karrablast `sv10.5b-009`/`-094`, Shelmet `sv10.5w-008`/`-093` "Stimulated
        Evolution" — while the NAMED PARTNER is anywhere in `seat`'s play,
        **Active Spot or Bench, and in EITHER zone for the holder itself**.

    🛑 **ONE PREDICATE FOR TWO BANS, AND THAT PAIRING IS THE WHOLE POINT.** The
    printed sentence is *"it can evolve during your first turn **or the turn you
    play it**"*, and those two disjuncts are two different `err` returns:

      • `isFirstTurnOf(state, seat)`   → `FIRST_TURN_EVOLVE`  (turn.ts `evolve`)
      • `target.turnPlayed >= state.turn` → `EVOLVE_TOO_SOON` (turn.ts `evolve`)

    ⚠️ **IT DOES NOT COLLAPSE THE TWO ERROR CODES, AND MUST NOT.** A single
    "may this body evolve" predicate returning a boolean would lose the
    distinction between *"not on your first turn"* and *"not the turn it came
    into play"*, which are different messages about different boards and are
    separately asserted. Each ban line keeps its own `err`; this predicate only
    says whether to SKIP it.

    ⚠️ **IT DOES NOT REACH RARE CANDY, AND D278 PROVED THAT BY READING THE OTHER
    CARD.** `rareCandy`/`rareCandyOptions` (cardplay.ts) carry a restriction that
    coincides with §4/§10 clause for clause — *"You can't use this card during
    your first turn or on a Basic Pokémon that was put into play this turn"* — but
    it is printed on **Rare Candy**, and an Ability on the TARGET cannot lift a
    restriction a different card prints about its own use. Two rules that agree on
    every board are not one rule.

    🛑 **IT LIVES HERE, NOT IN continuous.ts, AND IT TAKES A SEAT — BOTH BECAUSE
    OF THE PARTNER GATE.** *"If you have Shelmet in play"* is seat-relative and
    `passivesOf` has no seat, so the clause is collected RAW by the fold and
    evaluated here where `conditionHolds` lives. That is `cantAttackUnless` /
    `attackBarredByAbility` one function up, verbatim, and it is the reason this
    module (which imports continuous.ts) is the right home. `seat` is the
    EVOLVING player — `evolve` has already proved the target is theirs.

    ⚠️ **THE ZONE CLAUSE IS STILL RESOLVED IN THE FOLD, AND ONLY FOR THE PRINTING
    THAT PRINTS IT.** Do not re-add `!onBench` here: three of the seven printings
    say "Active Spot" and four say nothing, and a blanket zone gate REFUSES a
    benched Karrablast the card licenses. That failure is invisible to every
    assertion made on an Active body.

    ⚠️ **THE §4 CHECK HAD TO MOVE BELOW TARGET RESOLUTION IN `evolve`.** Before
    D278 it refused on `isFirstTurnOf` as its SECOND statement, before the target
    existed. The licence is a fact about the TARGET BODY, so the ban cannot be
    answered without it. The observable consequence is an error-PRECEDENCE change
    on a first turn with an otherwise-invalid action (a garbled target now reports
    `BAD_TARGET` rather than `FIRST_TURN_EVOLVE`) — recorded because it is the
    kind of reorder that is invisible to every test using a well-formed action.

    Through `passivesOf` rather than off the top card directly: the licence is a
    printed ABILITY, so a §9 Ability-lock (Klefki `sv01-096`) must silence it and
    hand both bans back. Reading the catalog row here would be shorter and would
    get that wrong silently. */

    for the ATTACKING `seat`, plus every target-conditional one (Choice Belt)
    whose printed suffix matches the defender. The two attack-damage read sites
    (attack.ts's main hit and `snipeActive` below) share this so both gates are
    evaluated ONCE, here, beside the single `conditionHolds`: continuous.ts
    aggregates the passives but is seat-free and defender-free — a BoardCondition
    is relative to whose board it reads, and a target suffix to who is being hit,
    both of which only these sites know.

    ⚠️ D243 — AND A FOURTH TERM THAT IS NOT A `passivesOf` FOLD AT ALL. The three
    above all live on the ATTACKER's own body (its printed passive, its Tools, its
    Energy); the seat-wide aura ("Attacks used by your Pokémon do 20 more damage to
    your opponent's Active Pokémon") is printed on ONE body and paid to EVERY body
    the seat owns, so it is a board scan (`seatPreWRDamageBonus`) and not a fold.
    It is summed HERE rather than at the two call sites for this function's whole
    reason — one number, one §8.5 step, evaluated once — and it lands inside the
    returned total rather than beside it because it is `damageBonusBeforeWR`'s
    sentence with a different subject: same step, same sign, same §9-suppressible
    catalog channel, and the same `DAMAGE_DEALT.bonus` field is the right home for
    it (contrast `boostedAttackDamage`, which is a turn-stamped INSTALLATION and
    must be immune to a §9 lock, and so is summed at the site instead).

    ⚠️ THE ATTACKER'S CARD IS RESOLVED HERE AND NOT PASSED IN, which keeps both
    call sites at a ZERO signature diff — `pokemon` is already the attacking body
    and `topCardOf` is the same read `passivesOf` makes on the line above. */

/** 🆕 D358 — **DID THE ANSWER NAME A POKÉMON?** The `pokemon` choice carries an
    OPTIONAL ref since this slice, because an absent one is the printed decline of
    an *"up to N"* park (see `EffectChoice`), so every site that used to read
    `choice.kind === "pokemon"` now has a second question to ask. It is asked ONCE,
    here, rather than as nine copies of the same conjunction — and as a narrowing
    predicate rather than a bare boolean, so each call site keeps reading
    `choice.ref` with no non-null assertion and no re-check.

    ⚠️ **EIGHT OF THE NINE CALL SITES CANNOT SEE A DECLINE TODAY, AND THAT IS A
    VALIDATOR GUARANTEE RATHER THAN A TYPE ONE.** `attachEnergyFrom` is the only op
    that sets `declinable`, and `validateChoice` refuses a ref-less answer to every
    prompt without it — so switch / gust / returnBenched / healChosen / the two
    counter moves / both evolve-body continuations reach their `: state` ending on
    this predicate only through a path the wire cannot open. They are written
    anyway, and NOT as unreachable branches (D205's rule): this predicate is the
    same shape as the `choice.kind` test it replaces, which is itself a
    validator-unreachable belt at all nine sites. What is refused is a NEW arm
    saying something different per op — a decline moves nothing, everywhere, and
    the one ending they already share says exactly that. */

      The M1 no-choice rule auto-applies a lone candidate because a question with
      one answer is not a question — true of a MANDATORY pick and false of this
      one, where a single offered body still leaves `upTo + 1` answers.
      So a park with a ceiling asks at EVERY non-empty candidate set.
      **D47 decided this exact question for `choosePokemonMulti` and its review
      REVERSED the first draft on it**: honouring the right only above the
      auto-resolve threshold honours it *"exactly where declining matters
      least"*, since that is the board where the player has the most other
      outs. The zero arm is untouched — a decline and a whiff produce the same
      board, and asking a question with no candidates is not a decision either.

      🆕 **AND THIS IS THE ARM THAT REACHES THE `toSelf` PRINTINGS AT ALL.**
      *"attach up to 2 … to **this Pokémon**"* offers ONE candidate by
      construction, so before D359 seven legal printings resolved their printed
      ceiling without ever asking the controller anything.

      ⚠️ ABSENT-WHEN-UNDEFINED, like `decider` above it, so all eight mandatory

/** 🆕🆕 **D429 EXPORTED THIS, AND THE EXPORT IS SAFE FOR THE SAME REASON THE
    PRE-DAMAGE SEAM EXISTS: IT RETURNS A BOARD.** Row 74 of the attack corpus prints
    *"…If you discarded a Pokémon Tool in this way, your opponent's Active Pokémon is
    now Paralyzed."* — a §12 condition applied BEFORE the damage step, conditioned on
    what the pre-damage act just did. `attack.ts`'s `applyAttackPreDamage` calls this
    directly rather than re-deriving the rule, so the two §12 gates below (§11's
    `effectRefused` and the printed `statusImmunities`) are asked ONCE in the engine
    instead of twice.

    🛑 **AND IT IS NOT A HOLE IN THE "NO PARK BEFORE DAMAGE" PROPERTY.** This function
    is TOTAL and synchronous: `GameState` in, `GameState` out, no `RunResult`, no
    prompt, no continuation. Calling it from the pre-damage seam therefore cannot
    introduce the one thing that seam forbids. That is the check to re-run before
    exporting any other op implementation to it — the op's own SIGNATURE, not its
    behaviour today.

    ⚠️ The `op` argument is constructed by the caller rather than lifted out of a
    program, and it never reaches `phase.cont`: the pre-damage seam never parks, so
    no `EffectContinuation` is written and `MATCH_RECORD_VERSION` is untouched. */

/** §12 (D177) — the DISCRETE recovery. `applyStatus`'s exact inverse and its
    neighbour on purpose: same resolution to ONE Active, same `uid === undefined`
    early return, same STATUS_* row, opposite direction. Two printings reach it —
    Gardevoir ex's "Miracle Force" (an ATTACK, through the deriver) and Blissey's
    "Busybody Nurse" (an activated ABILITY, through the registry) — and both mean
    the CONTROLLER's own Active, which is why there is no `target` to resolve.

    ⚠️ IT CLEARS ITS TARGET DIRECTLY AND DOES **NOT** REUSE `recoverStatuses`
    (flow.ts). THIS WAS THE SLICE'S OPEN QUESTION AND IT WAS PRICED, NOT ASSUMED —
    three independent reasons, any one of which is sufficient:

      1. **THE DRIVER IS WRONG.** `recoverStatuses` is driven off
         `passivesOf(...).statusRecovery` — a CATALOG value contributed by a live
         continuous source. This op has no such source: its warrant is that it ran.
         Reusing the sweep would mean writing a synthetic passive onto the board so
         a function could read it back off, which is a continuous effect
         impersonating an instant one. Strip the `statusRecovery` read and there is
         no `recoverStatuses` left.
      2. **THE SCOPE IS WRONG.** That function is a TWO-SEAT board sweep restoring
         a board-wide invariant (*no in-play Pokémon carries a condition a live
         effect recovers it from*). This is one body, named by the printed subject,
         at one moment. A sweep would touch the opponent's Active as well — a no-op
         on today's catalog, and a rule this card does not print on tomorrow's.
      3. **THE SET IS WRONG.** Its per-condition filter (`recovers.includes`) is
         what makes sv02-193 wake a body and leave its Burn ticking. "All Special
         Conditions" has no such filter, so `noConditions()` is the whole clear —
         and passing an all-five list into a filter designed to narrow is a filter
         written to be inert.

    ⚠️ WHAT **IS** SHARED IS THE VOCABULARY, WHICH IS THE PART THAT MATTERED. Both
    halves announce `STATUS_CLEARED` with `reason: "recovered"` — the printed verb,
    one reading, one log arm (log.ts renders "X recovered from Y" for both), so a
    consumer cannot tell a continuous recovery from a discrete one by its ROW and
    does not need to: the card says "recovers" in both mouths. A second reason
    would have been a second rendering of the same word (D131).

    ⚠️ AND IT IS `noConditions()` RATHER THAN THREE FIELD WRITES, WHICH IS THE
    THIRD EXISTING SITE FOR THAT CALL AND NOT A FOURTH SPELLING. turn.ts's retreat
    and evolve clears are this same shape — `presentStatuses` for the row, the
    zero value for the board — because "all of them" is what all three sentences
    say. `recoverStatuses`'s three-arm loop exists precisely because ITS sentence
    does not.

    NO §11 GATE, and the absence is deliberate rather than forgotten.
    `attackEffectRefused` refuses effects done TO the body carrying a "prevent all
    damage from and effects of attacks" block; this op touches only the ATTACKER's
    own Active, which is never that body (a block is live during its holder's
    OPPONENT's turn). A gate here would ask the defender for permission to heal
    yourself.

    SILENT WHEN THERE IS NOTHING TO RECOVER FROM — no event, no board change, and
    NOT an `ATTACK_EFFECT_SKIPPED` (the sentence was read; it found nothing). That
    also makes it idempotent, so a program running it twice costs one scan. */

    next turn, they can't play any Item cards from their hand." — Galvantula ex,
    Budew, Frillish). The ONE writer of `GameState.handPlayLockedTurn`.

    🛑 **`state.turn + 1` AND NOT `+ 2`, AND THE NUMBER IS DECIDED BY WHOSE TURN
    IT IS.** `preventAttack` one function down stamps `+ 1` on the DEFENDER and
    `+ 2` on itself, because "their next turn" and "your next turn" are one round
    apart; every printing of THIS sentence says *their*, so the window is the
    seat that plays next (§5.3: an attack ends the turn and `turnTail` queues
    `startTurn(otherSeat)`), which is `state.turn + 1` by construction.

    🛑 **NO `effectRefused` GATE, AND THAT IS A RULES DECISION RATHER THAN AN
    OMISSION.** `preventRetreat` directly above, `preventAttack` and
    `weakenDefenderAttacks` all ask it, because each is an effect of an attack
    done TO THE DEFENDING POKÉMON and a §11 "prevent all effects of attacks done
    to this Pokémon" block refuses exactly those. This op touches no
    `InPlayPokemon` at all: its object is the opponent's HAND, which no block
    printed on a body shields. Asking would install a bug in the shape of a
    safety check — a Mew ex behind a block would silently keep its Supporters.

    NO ACTIVE-SPOT PRECONDITION either, and that is the same fact from the other
    side: every sibling above returns early on `active === null` because it has
    nowhere to write. This one writes to the seat, so a barred player with an
    empty Active Spot (mid-KO, awaiting a promotion) is barred all the same.

    IDEMPOTENT BY THE STAMP, not by an early return: two installs in one turn
    compute the same `state.turn + 1`, so the second write is the value the first
    one left. The row is emitted each time, which is honest — two attacks really
    did print the sentence — and no board in this catalog can reach it (an attack
    ends the turn), so an early return would be a line that cannot go red. */

    ("During your opponent's next turn, prevent all damage [from and effects of]
    attacks done to this Pokémon.", 13 printings across two spellings, D142).
    "This Pokémon" is `ctx.seat`'s Active — the attacker, resolved exactly the way
    `healSelf` and `damageSelf` resolve their own printed "this Pokémon" — so the
    op carries no `target` and there is nothing to choose, hence no park.

    THE STAMP IS `state.turn + 1`, AND THAT ARITHMETIC IS THE WHOLE DURATION.
    Declaring an attack ENDS the turn (§5.3), so the turn after the installing one
    is by construction the opponent's; the block is therefore live for exactly the
    window the card prints, is NOT live for the remainder of the installing turn
    (the printed word is "next"), and is dead again on the holder's following turn
    with nobody having cleared it. The one place that arithmetic could go wrong is
    a caller that is not an attack — an Ability installing this mid-turn would
    stamp its own opponent's turn correctly too, but no such printing exists and
    the op is refused to the deriver's Ability path by not being derivable there.

    IDEMPOTENT: installing twice in one turn writes the same stamp, and the second
    row is suppressed only when the second install says nothing new — a NARROW
    block landing on top of a WIDE one must not silently downgrade it, so the two
    are merged by OR rather than overwritten. Reachable in principle (a card with
    two such attacks, or a re-install after a switch), unreachable in this pool.

    ⚠️ D146's `fromClass` MERGES ON THE SAME RULE READ ON THE OTHER AXIS. `effects`
    widens what is refused, so two installs OR it; `fromClass` NARROWS whose
    attacks are refused at all, so two installs keep the filter only when they
    AGREE, and any disagreement (including one side having no filter) collapses to
    the UNFILTERED block. Both rules say the same thing — a second installation
    may never leave the holder with less protection than one of them printed — and
    writing them as one comparison rather than one `||` is the only reason they
    look different. Unreachable in this pool for the same reason as above, and
    doubly so: no card prints two of these attacks, and the four filtered printings
    are one attack each.

    ⚠️ D239 MADE THAT COMPARISON STRUCTURAL, AND IT WAS A LIVE DEFECT THE MOMENT
    THE FIELD BECAME A RECORD. `existing.fromClass === fromClass` was exact while
    the field was a string literal; against two `AttackerClass` records it is
    REFERENCE equality, so two installs of the SAME printed class would have
    "disagreed" and collapsed to an unfiltered block — a silent WIDENING, which is
    the one direction this family's merge rule is written to forbid.

    ⚠️ D240's `maxDamage` MERGES ON `fromClass`'s RULE VERBATIM, because it narrows
    on the same side: two installs keep the cap only when they AGREE, and any
    disagreement (including one side having no cap at all) collapses to the
    UNCAPPED block. That is the family's one rule stated a third time — a second
    installation may never leave the holder with less protection than one of them
    printed — and it is why the merge is NOT `Math.max` of the two caps: a 40-cap
    and an uncapped install have no maximum to take, and the uncapped one is
    already the wider of the two. Unreachable in this pool for the reasons above
    (no card prints two of these attacks; the three capped printings are one
    attack each). */

/** §8/§11 (D143, widened D148) — INSTALL the printed ATTACK LOCK on the Pokémon
    the sentence names: the CONTROLLER's own Active with `target` absent ("During
    your next turn, this Pokémon can't attack.", 22 printings across two
    sentences), the DEFENDING Pokémon with `target: "defender"` ("…the Defending
    Pokémon can't attack.", 4 printings across two more). `preventDamage`'s sibling
    one function up on the self arm and `preventRetreat`'s exact sibling on the
    defender arm — same holder resolution, same no-park, same idempotence.

    ⚠️ THE STAMP IS DERIVED FROM THE HOLDER, AND THAT IS WHY `target` IS ONE AXIS.
    There is exactly ONE rule here — *the window is the locked Pokémon's
    controller's NEXT turn* — and the two numbers this function can write are that
    rule evaluated on the two seats, because DECLARING AN ATTACK ENDS THE TURN
    (§5.3). The turn after the installing one belongs to the opponent, so the
    defender's next turn is `+ 1`; the one after THAT is the installer's own, so
    the self arm is `+ 2`. The printed wordings differ for the identical reason
    ("during YOUR next turn" / "during your OPPONENT's next turn"), which is the
    tell that they are one rule and not two. A build that shared one number would
    be wrong on one arm; a build that carried the number in the op would let a
    deriver write a window the printed subject contradicts.

    D143's warning survives on its own arm: `+ 1` on the SELF lock fails quietly in
    play rather than loudly, because a `+ 1` self-lock is live only on a turn its
    holder could not have acted on anyway and the card's whole printed drawback
    silently disappears. The mirror is just as quiet — `+ 2` on the DEFENDER arm
    would skip the printed window entirely and bite on a turn two later. Both are
    driven across real turn boundaries rather than asserted as arithmetic.

    ⚠️ THE DEFENDER ARM IS AN EFFECT OF AN ATTACK DONE TO THE DEFENDING POKÉMON,
    so a §11 block that refuses "effects of attacks" refuses THIS — `preventRetreat`'s
    check verbatim, and reachable off printed cards (the defender installs
    `{ effects: true }` on their turn, its window is the installer's very next
    turn, and that is the turn this lock would land on). Asked on the RESOLVED seat
    so the rule is TOTAL over both arms rather than written on one of them: the
    self arm can never be refused in practice (a block is live only during its
    holder's OPPONENT's turn, and the self arm runs on the holder's own), and
    asking anyway costs one read and removes a case from the reasoning — which is
    the call `applyStatus` already made for its own two arms.

    IDEMPOTENT, and on the self arm that is by construction rather than by care:
    installing needs an attack, an attack ends the turn, and a locked Pokémon
    cannot declare the attack that would re-install. The DEFENDER arm makes the
    question live for the first time — two installers can lock one body — and the
    answer is that a later stamp is never an EARLIER turn than the one it replaces:
    every install writes its holder's next turn measured from the install, and
    installs are ordered in time, so the sequence of stamps on any one body is
    monotone. That is also why a `Math.max` would be a merge rule with nothing to
    merge (contrast `reduceDamage`, whose two sources really can disagree). The
    early-return keeps a re-install that says nothing new SILENT — D142's
    idempotence answer, and the case is real here: a self-lock stamped `+ 2` and a
    defender-lock stamped `+ 1` from the opponent's following turn are the SAME
    number on the same body, so the second install emits no second row. */

    site in this engine speaks. `findIndex` over the holder's OWN printed attacks,
    so a sentence naming an attack the card does not have resolves to `-1` and its
    op writes nothing.

    ⚠️ BOTH SIDES ARE APOSTROPHE-FOLDED (D137's rule, D154's reach). The op's token
    was folded at the deriver; the card's `name` is folded here, because a
    punctuation-normalising re-ingest would rewrite BOTH the sentence and the
    attack row it names — Greedent ex sv03-179's "Slip 'n' Roll" is the printing
    that makes it visible — and folding one side only is the half-fix that reads
    like a whole one.

    ⚠️ IT IS A SHARED HELPER RATHER THAN TWO COPIES, AND THE GROUND IS THAT THE
    FOLD IS INVISIBLE WHEN MISSING. D154 measured exactly that: removing its
    install-side fold failed NOTHING until a card whose attack name carries U+2019
    was added to the pool (`fix-curly-barrer`). A second copy of these two lines
    would be a second place that can silently lose the fold, covered by no witness
    unless the next slice remembers to field a second curly card. One copy makes
    that one witness load-bearing for every op that resolves a printed attack name
    — today `preventAttackUse` (D154) and `boostAttack` (D155). */

/** §8/§11 (D165) — ADD one per-attack bar to a body's list, or say that it adds
    nothing. THE ONE MERGE RULE for `InPlayPokemon.lockedAttacks`, shared by both
    of that field's writers — `preventAttackUse` (D154, self-side, `+ 2`) and
    `lockDefenderAttack` (D157, opponent-side, `+ 1`).

    ⚠️ IT IS A SHARED HELPER RATHER THAN TWO COPIES BECAUSE TWO COPIES ARE THE
    DEFECT IT EXISTS TO FIX. Both writers previously did the same bare overwrite,
    each guarded by the same same-turn-same-index early return, and each was
    correct about ITSELF: a self-side re-install always stamps a later turn, and
    §5.3 forbids a second declaration inside one turn. Neither asked what the
    OTHER one stamps. `+ 2` from turn 3 and `+ 1` from turn 4 are both 5, so the
    later write silently deleted a live bar and the §8 gate let a Skarmory use the
    "Slashing Steel" its own card bars. One function means the question "what
    happens when this lands on a live record" has exactly one answer and exactly
    one place a mutation can reach it.

    THREE RULES, AND EACH IS DRIVEN (`lockedAttackMerge.test.ts`):
      • IDEMPOTENT on the pair — the same `turn` AND the same `attackIndex` adds
        nothing and returns `null`, so the caller suppresses its row (D142's
        idempotence answer, both writers' early return preserved verbatim);
      • ADDITIVE on a DIFFERING index — the entry is APPENDED and no live entry is
        touched, which is the whole of D165. A differing index for a DIFFERENT
        turn is likewise appended rather than replacing: it names a window the
        body has not reached, and dropping it would be the same deletion one turn
        further out;
      • PRUNED on the PAST — entries whose `turn` is strictly behind `now` can
        never answer again (the turn counter only rises), so they are dropped on
        every write. That is what keeps the list bounded by the number of bars
        stamped for turns not yet played, rather than by the length of the match.
        It is a garbage rule and NOT an expiry rule: expiry is the reader's turn
        comparison (`lockedAttackIndexes`), which is what makes a bar stop biting.

    🆕🆕 **D421 ADDS A FOURTH KIND OF ENTRY AND BOTH PREDICATES ABOVE HAD TO
    BRANCH — NEITHER WAS FREE, AND EITHER ONE ALONE IS THE DEFECT.** *"This
    Pokémon can't use Blaze Blitz again until it leaves the Active Spot."* (5
    legal printings, Gouging Fire ex) installs `until: "leavesActive"`, an entry
    with NO window: its `turn` is the install turn and is provenance only.
      • the PRUNE would collect it on the very next write, because that number is
        behind `now` from the following turn onwards — a live, unbounded bar
        deleted by the rule that exists to bound the list;
      • the IDEMPOTENCE KEY would miss it, because the pair (turn, index) calls a
        re-install on a later turn a NEW fact — appending a duplicate the two
        payability projections publish as a repeated index and the log as a second
        row about a bar the player already has.
    Both are driven (`untilLeavesActiveBar.test.ts` §6), and the pair is why the
    rider is checked in two places in one function rather than folded into one.

    ⚠️ AND THE PRUNE'S `>=` IS THE ONE CHARACTER THIS FUNCTION'S BOUNDARY TURNS ON
    — D166's finding, and the reason D165 shipped with an unfinished verification.
    An entry stamped for `now` is LIVE right now, so `> now` would DELETE A BAR THAT
    IS STILL BITING: D165's own defect relocated out of the merge rule and into the
    garbage rule. D165's mutation pass was interrupted exactly here; re-run at D166
    it produced FIVE survivors rather than the two recorded, all of them the same
    off-by-one (`> now`, `>= now + 1`, `>= turn`, and either writer passing `turn`
    rather than `state.turn` as `now`). All five are now witnessed and the boundary
    is pinned from BOTH sides (`>= now - 1`, which keeps one dead turn, fails too).

    THE TWO WRITERS DO NOT REACH THE EQUAL CASE ALIKE, AND THE ARGUMENT IS PARITY.
    Both stamp the HOLDER's own next turn, so every entry on a body carries that
    seat's turn parity. `preventAttackUse` writes on its OWN Active during its own
    turn, so `lock.turn === now` is REACHABLE — an opponent-imposed bar live this
    turn, plus this turn's own self-install — and is driven as a PLAYED LINE.
    `lockDefenderAttack` writes on the OPPONENT's Active during the actor's turn, so
    `now` is never one of the victim's turns and the equal case is UNREACHABLE by
    parity; it is driven by SURGERY instead, said rather than skipped, because this
    is ONE function with ONE contract and the parity it leans on is a property of
    today's two writers rather than of the shape (`lockedAttackMerge.test.ts`).

    Returns the NEW list, or `null` when the write is a no-op. `null` rather than
    the old array by identity, because "nothing changed" is a fact the caller acts
    on (it suppresses an `ATTACK_LOCKED` row) and a reference comparison would
    make that fact depend on whether the prune happened to allocate. */

    across 4 names plus 1 fielded uncatalogued printing). `preventAttack`'s
    sibling one function up, and written beneath it so the pair reads as one
    design:

    | | `preventAttack` (D143/D148) | this (D154) |
    |---|---|---|
    | Holder | `ctx.seat`'s Active, or the defender's | `ctx.seat`'s Active |
    | Stamp  | `+ 2` self / `+ 1` defender            | `+ 2`               |
    | State  | `attackLockedTurn: number`             | `lockedAttack: { turn, attackIndex }` |
    | Gate   | the whole DECLARATION                  | ONE index of it     |

    ⚠️ THE PRINTED NAME IS RESOLVED HERE, AND THIS IS THE ONLY SITE THAT KNOWS IT.
    The deriver captures a PROPER NOUN because that is what the sentence contains;
    every consumer of the record addresses attacks by INDEX (attack.ts's §8 gate
    compares `action.index`, and both payability projections map over
    `attacksOf(card)`). So the lookup happens once, at the install, against the
    HOLDER's own stack-top card — the same call D152's deriver made converting
    counters to HP, in the same direction: translate at the site that owns the
    printed token, so nothing downstream has to know a sentence named anything.

    ⚠️ A NAME THAT MATCHES NOTHING INSTALLS NOTHING, AND SILENTLY. Unreachable off
    every printing in the pool — all six name their own attack — so it is a
    CONSTRUCTED case and it is pinned as one. The alternative (stamping an index
    of −1, or the printed name itself) would put a value into a persisted record
    that no read site can act on, and the alternative to THAT (emitting a row
    anyway) would tell a player about a drawback that cannot bite. A lock on an
    attack the card does not have is inert; the honest representation of inert is
    absence (D140/D146: a gate that declines emits nothing).

    ⚠️ NO `attackEffectRefused` CHECK, AND THAT IS `reduceDamage`'s AND
    `installRecoil`'s VERDICT AND NOT AN OMISSION. The record lands on the ACTOR's
    own Active, so there is no opponent-side body a §11 "prevent all effects of
    attacks done to this Pokémon" could be protecting from it. The §11
    classification table (preventBlock.test.ts) carries the verdict AND a board
    that drives it, which is D150's rule.

    IDEMPOTENT, and here that is by construction exactly as D143's self arm was:
    installing needs an attack, an attack ends the turn, and the window is the
    holder's own next turn — on which the only attack that could re-install is the
    very one this record bars. So a second install of THIS op can never land on a
    live record of THIS op, and `addLockedAttack`'s early return covers the
    constructed case (same turn AND same index → silent, D142's idempotence
    answer).

    ⚠️ AND THE SENTENCE THAT USED TO END THAT PARAGRAPH — *"a differing index
    simply overwrites, because a later install always stamps a later turn"* — WAS
    THE DEFECT D165 FIXED. It is true of this op about itself and false about the
    field, which `lockDefenderAttack` also writes with a `+ 1` stamp: from the
    turn after this one those two land on the SAME number, and the overwrite
    deleted a live bar. The merge is now `addLockedAttack`'s and is APPENDING. */

    here — strip `amount` and you have D154's record byte for byte — which is the
    first time in this family it has, so the refusal has to be made on the READ.
    `lockedAttackIndex`'s consumer refuses the declaration whose index it returns;
    this one's pays it a bonus. One field would hand the §8 gate the index of the
    attack the card just bought, and a Seismitoad that spent a turn on +100 could
    not then declare "Echoed Voice". Driven on one board rather than argued
    (perAttackBuff.test.ts), which is what this repo asks of a design answer.

    ⚠️ THE PRINTED NAME IS RESOLVED HERE BY `preventAttackUse`'s OWN HELPER, and
    sharing it is the point rather than a tidy-up: the apostrophe fold it carries is
    invisible when missing (D154 measured that), so one copy makes that slice's one
    curly-named witness load-bearing for both ops. A name matching nothing on the
    holder installs NOTHING and emits no row — a bonus on an attack the card does
    not have is inert, and announcing it would tell a player about a payoff that
    cannot arrive (D140/D146: a gate that declines emits nothing).

    ⚠️ NO `attackEffectRefused` CHECK, for `reduceDamage`'s, `installRecoil`'s and
    `preventAttackUse`'s verdict verbatim: the record lands on the ACTOR's own
    Active, so there is no opponent-side body a §11 "prevent all effects of attacks
    done to this Pokémon" could be protecting from it. The §11 classification table
    (preventBlock.test.ts) carries the verdict AND a board that drives it (D150).

    IDEMPOTENT BY `Math.max` ON THE AMOUNT, WHICH IS `reduceDamage`'s RULE AND NOT
    `preventAttackUse`'s EARLY RETURN — because this record carries a number and
    that one does not. The rule both are instances of is *a second installation may
    never leave the holder with less than one of them printed*: for an address that
    is "the later write wins", for a number that is MAX. The merge is per-ADDRESS,
    so a second install naming a DIFFERENT attack replaces the record outright
    rather than keeping the larger of two unrelated bonuses — the amount is a
    property of the pair, not of the body. Unreachable off the one printing (an
    attack ends the turn, and the window is the holder's own next turn), so it is
    constructed and pinned; the row is suppressed when the merge says nothing new

    diff. D155 refused to merge `boostedAttack` into that record on exactly this
    axis and reached the opposite answer, because ITS consumer PAYS the index the
    other refuses. Same test, two results, decided by the read site both times.

    ⚠️ AND IT IS `blocked` BY §11, WHERE ITS TWO SIBLINGS ARE `untouched` — the
    first op in the per-attack family that a wide block stops. Those write onto the
    CONTROLLER's own Active, so there is no opponent-side body a "prevent all
    effects of attacks done to this Pokémon" could be protecting from them; this
    one writes onto the DEFENDING Pokémon, which is squarely an effect of an attack
    done to it — `preventRetreat`'s, `weakenDefenderAttacks`'s and D148's
    `preventAttack { target: "defender" }`'s verdict verbatim. The refusal is taken
    IN FRONT OF the candidate scan, `discardEnergy`'s placement and for its reason:
    a shielded defender must never reach the prompt, because asking a player to
    pick an attack that will not be barred is worse than not asking.

    THE STAMP IS `state.turn + 1` — D142/D148's number. One rule (the window is
    the LOCKED Pokémon's controller's next turn) on the other seat: declaring an
    attack ENDS the turn (§5.3), so the turn after this one belongs to the victim.

    ⚠️ THE ENDINGS ARE `parkOrForce`'s THREE, ON A CANDIDATE SET THAT IS NOT A
    LIST OF POKÉMON — which is why they are spelled here rather than routed
    through that helper. No Active, or an Active whose card cannot be resolved, or
    an Active with NO printed attacks (fix-titan is one, and so is any body the
    catalog gives no `attacks_json`): a silent no-op, because a lock on a Pokémon
    with nothing to lock is inert and the honest representation of inert is absence
    (D140/D146 — a gate that declines emits nothing). EXACTLY ONE printed attack:
    forced, applied inline with no prompt (the M1 doctrine — a choice with no
    choice in it is not a choice), and this is the board on which this op and
    D148's whole-Pokémon lock become observationally identical. Two or more: park.
    **All three are reachable off the two printings** — a one-attack defender is an
    ordinary board — so none of them is a constructed case. */

    contract, restated for a candidate set that is not a list of Pokémon.

    ⚠️ THE INDEX IS RE-VALIDATED AGAINST THE LIVE BOARD, WHICH THE POKÉMON PROMPTS
    DO NOT HAVE TO DO. A `PokemonRef` answer is checked against the prompt AND
    resolved against the board on the way in; an index is a plain number, and the
    board it indexes could in principle have moved between the park and the answer

    IDEMPOTENT by `addLockedAttack`'s EARLY RETURN rather than by `boostAttack`'s
    `Math.max`, because this record carries an address and no number: same turn AND
    same index is silent. Unlike its self-side twin the re-install is REACHABLE in
    principle — two of the controller's own attacks could both bar the defender on
    the same turn only if one attack declared twice, which §5.3 forbids — so it is
    pinned as a constructed case.

    ⚠️ A DIFFERING INDEX **APPENDS** SINCE D165, AND THAT IS THE FIX. This op and
    `preventAttackUse` are the field's TWO writers, they stamp `+ 1` and `+ 2`,
    and from adjacent turns those are the SAME turn — so the bare overwrite this
    line used to do deleted the victim's own live self-installed bar and handed
    them back an attack their card forbids. The merge rule is `addLockedAttack`'s

    two sentences and four amounts). `preventDamage`'s neighbour two functions up,
    and written beside it on purpose: same holder resolution ("this Pokémon" is
    `ctx.seat`'s Active, the attacker), same absence of a `target` field, same
    no-park, same `state.turn + 1` stamp, same idempotence question.

    construction. It is the same NUMBER `attackBlock.turn` carries, which is why
    the two windows can be driven apart only by what they DO, never by when.

    ⚠️ IDEMPOTENT BY `Math.max`, WHICH IS D142's `||` WITH THE BOOLEAN REPLACED BY
    A NUMBER — and the alternative is written down rather than left implicit. The
    rule both are instances of is *a second installation may never leave the holder

    printing (one attack per turn, and no card prints two of these), so it is
    constructed and pinned; the day a printing installs this on the DEFENDER, the
    field becomes a list and the sum becomes the live question.

    same absence of a `target` field, same no-park, same `state.turn + 1` stamp.

    THE STAMP IS `state.turn + 1` FOR `reduceDamage`'s REASON VERBATIM — the
    sentence prints "during your OPPONENT's next turn", declaring an attack ENDS
    the turn (§5.3), so the turn after the installing one is the opponent's by
    construction.

    ⚠️ IDEMPOTENT **BY THE STAMP**, WHICH IS `retreatLockedTurn`'s ANSWER AND NOT
    `reduceDamage`'s `Math.max`. That op merges because it holds a NUMBER and two
    installs can disagree about it; this record holds only a turn, so a second
    install in the same turn computes the same number and the write is the value
    the first one left. The early return is what suppresses the duplicate ROW —
    announcing a re-install that changed nothing would be announcing a non-event
    (D140/D146), the same rule `reduceDamage` states one function up. Unreachable
    off any printing (one attack per turn, and no card prints two of these), so it
    is constructed and pinned.

    ⚠️ NO `attackEffectRefused` CHECK, AND THAT IS `reduceDamage`'s AND
    `installRecoil`'s VERDICT AND NOT AN OMISSION. The record lands on the ACTOR's
    own Active, so there is no opponent-side body a §11 "prevent all effects of
    attacks done to this Pokémon" could be protecting from it. The §11
    classification table (preventBlock.test.ts) carries the verdict AND a board
    that drives it, which is D150's rule.

    ⚠️ AND THE READ IS SOMEWHERE ELSE ENTIRELY, which is the part a successor will
    want: this function only stamps. Both §8.5 sites that can apply Weakness —

    THE STAMP IS `state.turn + 1`, AND HERE THE ARITHMETIC AND THE HOLDER COME
    FROM TWO DIFFERENT PRECEDENTS. The printed words are "during your OPPONENT's
    next turn" and declaring an attack ENDS the turn (§5.3), so the turn after the
    installing one is the opponent's — D142's number verbatim. But the body is the
    OPPONENT's, which is D148's `target: "defender"` arm. The two agree here for
    the reason D148 wrote down: the window is always the HOLDER's controller's
    next turn, and on this op the holder is the opponent, so `+ 1` is that one
    rule and not a coincidence. (Contrast `preventAttack`'s self arm, where the
    same rule reads `+ 2`.)

    ⚠️ IT IS AN EFFECT OF AN ATTACK DONE TO THE DEFENDING POKÉMON, so a live §11
    block refuses it — `preventRetreat`'s and D148's `preventAttack` check
    verbatim, asked on the DEFENDER's seat because that is the body being written
    to. Reachable off printed cards rather than constructed: the defender installs
    a wide block on their own turn, its window is the installer's very next turn,
    and that is the turn this debuff would land on. The refusal is announced
    BEFORE the idempotence early-return, so an already-debuffed body still reports
    it (`preventRetreat`'s ordering).

    ⚠️ IDEMPOTENT BY `Math.max`, WHICH IS `reduceDamage`'s RULE READ FROM THE
    OTHER SEAT — *a second installation may never leave the INSTALLING side with
    less than one of them printed*, so for a number that is MAX. A SUM would be
    the other reading and is refused for the same reason: this field holds ONE
    installation with ONE window, so summing would make the stored number depend
    on how many times the record was written rather than on what was printed.
    Unreachable off any printing (one attack per turn, and the two installs would

    was already going to consult; nothing in the engine reads this one. The

    goes looking for the stamp at the end of every turn. **A build that ships this
    half alone resolves, emits its row, persists its record and never places a
    counter** — D407's built-but-dead defect, and the reason both halves carry their
    own mutant row rather than one shared one.

    `weakenDefenderAttacks` DIRECTLY ABOVE IS THE TEMPLATE and the resemblance is
    deliberate: same `otherSeat(ctx.seat)` holder, same §11 gate ahead of the
    idempotence return, same `state.turn + 1` stamp, same `Math.max` merge. The one
    difference is what the record is FOR, and it is the difference between a fact and
    an appointment.

    THE STAMP IS `state.turn + 1` FOR `weakenDefenderAttacks`' REASON VERBATIM — the
    sentence prints *"your opponent's next turn"*, declaring an attack ENDS the turn
    (§5.3), so the turn after the installing one is the opponent's by construction.
    `runCheckup` compares it to `state.turn` as it stands, and the Checkup runs
    BEFORE `startTurn` increments (flow.ts `knockOut`'s note), so the stamped turn is
    live at exactly one Checkup and never again.

    is deliberately payload-BLIND about that: the difference lives in `runCheckup`,
    where one path calls `discardFromStack` and the other hands the body to §8.1.

    ⚠️ NO PAYLOAD BEYOND THE CLOCK, which is D432's question asked again rather than

    | 179 | 1 | *"…put **6** damage counters…"* (and "even if **this Pokémon** is") |
    | 180 | 2 | *"…put damage counters … **equal to the damage done to this Pokémon**"* |

    Line 178 is the family this op serves; lines 179 and 180 are a different amount
    and a scaled amount and are NOT claimed here. ⚠️ **THE CARD IDS ARE STATED AS
    UNRESOLVED, NOT REPAIRED** (D425): this checkout has no D1, so the sentence text
    and the printing counts are measurable off the committed corpus and the ids
    behind them are not. "Lycanroc ex sv02-117/-241" is left in the history rather
    than re-asserted — it was quoted against a sentence that does not exist, so it
    cannot be trusted to name the printings of the one that does.

    `reduceDamage`'s SIBLING rather than `weakenDefenderAttacks`'s mirror, and
    written beneath the pair on purpose so all three read as one design:

    | | `reduceDamage` (D147) | `weakenDefenderAttacks` (D149) | this (D152) |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | Holder  | `ctx.seat`'s Active | `otherSeat(ctx.seat)`'s Active | `ctx.seat`'s Active |
    | Stamp   | `state.turn + 1`    | `state.turn + 1`               | `state.turn + 1`    |
    | Read at | §8.5, subtracted    | §8.5, subtracted               | §9, ADDED           |
    | §11-refusable | no (own body) | **YES** (opponent's body)      | no (own body)       |

    THE STAMP IS `state.turn + 1` FOR `reduceDamage`'s REASON VERBATIM — the
    sentence prints "during your OPPONENT's next turn", declaring an attack ENDS
    the turn (§5.3), so the turn after the installing one is the opponent's by
    construction. It is the same NUMBER `attackBlock.turn` and `damageReduction.turn`
    carry, which is why these windows can be driven apart only by what they DO.

    ⚠️ NO `attackEffectRefused` CHECK, AND THAT IS `reduceDamage`'s VERDICT AND NOT
    AN OMISSION. The record lands on the ACTOR's own Active, so there is no
    opponent-side body a §11 "prevent all effects of attacks done to this Pokémon"
    could be protecting from it. The §11 classification table (preventBlock.test.ts)
    carries the verdict AND a board that drives it, which is D150's rule: a slice
    that teaches the deriver a new op owes both.

    ⚠️ IDEMPOTENT BY `Math.max`, WHICH IS `reduceDamage`'s RULE ON ITS OWN SEAT —
    *a second installation may never leave the holder with less than one of them
    printed*, so for a number that is MAX. A SUM would be the other reading and is
    refused for the same reason: this field holds ONE installation with ONE window,
    so summing would make the stored number depend on how many times the record was
    written rather than on what was printed. (Note the CONTRAST one file over: the
    §9 read site really does SUM this stamp with `passivesOf`'s catalog fold,
    because those are two different card effects from two different sources. One
    field, one installation, MAX; two sources, SUM.) Unreachable off any printing
    (one attack per turn, and no card prints two of these), so it is constructed
    and pinned. The row is suppressed when the merge says nothing new, exactly as
    the two above (D140/D142/D146). */

/** §11 (D142) — is an ATTACK's effect aimed at `seat`'s Active refused by that
    Pokémon's own live block, and has the refusal been announced? The ONE gate
    every defender-relative effect op consults, so the reading is written once.

    BOTH HALVES ARE REQUIRED, and neither is redundant:
      • `ctx.invokedBy === "attack"` — the block covers "effects of ATTACKS", and
        the opponent may well play a Trainer or use an Ability during the very
        turn the window is open. Crushing Hammer discarding an Energy and Boss's
        Orders dragging a body up are not attacks and are not refused.
      • `attackBlockOf(...)?.effects` — the LIVE block, and the wider of the two
        printed spellings. The narrow one ("prevent all damage done to this
        Pokémon by attacks") stops damage and nothing else, so a Poison, a retreat
        lock or a placed damage COUNTER all land on a body carrying it. That is
        the printed difference and it is the slice's sharpest observable claim.

    A refusal is LOUD: one ATTACK_EFFECT_PREVENTED row per refused op, because the
    alternative is an attack clause that silently does nothing, which reads to a
    player exactly like a bug. */
/** §11/§8.5 (D142) — is ATTACK DAMAGE aimed at `pokemon` refused by its own live
    block? `attackEffectRefused`'s silent twin, and the difference between them is
    the whole of the two printed spellings: BOTH block damage, so this one does
    not read `effects`, and it announces nothing because `DAMAGE_DEALT` already
    carries `prevented: true` for it.

    It takes the POKÉMON rather than a seat because the three interpreter damage
    sites are per-target (a spread hits five bodies), and it is applied at all
    three plus `attack.ts`'s main hit for the reason Mimikyu "Safeguard" is: the
    sites must be TOTAL rather than case-covering. A block can in fact only ever
    be live on an ACTIVE — installing it needs an attack, and leaving the Active
    Spot ends it (turn.ts `clearOnLeavingActive`, interpreter `switchInto`) — so
    the Bench-target arms are unreachable by construction and are guarded anyway,
    which costs one read and removes a standing assumption.

    It takes the ATTACKING CARD too, since D146: a block may be narrowed to
    attacks "from Basic Pokémon", and `attackBlockOf` resolves that against the
    attacker rather than answering it here (continuous.ts). Every caller already
    had the card in hand for Mimikyu "Safeguard" on the very next line, which is
    why the two auras still sit on one `||` at all four sites.

    It takes the DAMAGE too, since D240: a block may be capped at "40 or less", and
    `attackBlockOf` resolves that against the number rather than answering it here
    (continuous.ts, where the choice of WHICH number is argued in full). ⚠️ Unlike
    the attacking card, the amount was NOT already in the callers' hands in the
    right form — every one of the three computed its reduction AFTER this call and
    folded the subtraction into `dealt`. So each site now hoists that arithmetic
    into a named `wouldDeal` above the `prevented` expression and spells it once
    instead of twice, which is the only structural edit D240 makes outside this
    file's own signature. */

  //
  // ⚠️ D253 ADDS A SECOND AURA AND IT IS PROVABLY DEAD HERE, WHICH IS RECORDED
  // RATHER THAN HIDDEN. `target` is `state.players[seat].active` two screens up —

  // forced switch at a BENCHED body, the refusal is already where it belongs. No
  // mutant is authored against this disjunct for exactly the same reason — one
  // could not be killed, and an unkillable mutant is a corpus defect, not coverage.

/** §11 — is an effect aimed at `seat`'s `target` refused, and if so SAY SO? The
    announcing wrapper around the predicate above, and the funnel every one of the
    interpreter's effect ops has consulted since D142.

    🆕 D259 RENAMED IT FROM `attackEffectRefused` AND GAVE IT A `target`, AND BOTH
    ARE THE TRAINER CHANNEL'S DOING. The old name stopped being true the moment a
    Supporter could be refused; the old body resolved `state.players[seat].active`
    itself, which was correct while EVERY caller was attack-borne (§8 aims at an
    Active) and is wrong the instant a Crushing Hammer names a benched body. So the
    parameter is OPTIONAL and defaults to exactly what the function used to compute
    — all eight pre-existing call sites are byte-unchanged, and only the sites that
    genuinely know a different body pass one.

    ⚠️ THE DEFAULT IS NOT A CONVENIENCE, IT IS THE PROOF THAT THE WIDENING IS A
    WIDENING. Had the parameter been required, eight call sites would each have
    re-spelled `state.players[seat].active` and the next benched-target op would
    have had eight places to get wrong instead of one.

    🆕🆕🛑 **D430 EXPORTED IT, AND THE EXPORT IS SAFE FOR THE PROPERTY D429 WROTE AT
    THE TYPE RATHER THAN FOR THE SHAPE OF ITS RETURN.** `attack.ts`'s pre-damage
    strip (`stripPreDamage`) is an EFFECT of an attack done to a Pokémon and had
    never consulted this gate at all, while its sibling consequent one arm over
    (row 74's Paralysis, through `applyStatus`) always had — so one printed sentence
    had one half gated and one half not, on a board Mist Energy `sv05-161` and Klefki
    `sv01-096` can reach today. The check to re-run before exporting anything else to
    that seam is the SIGNATURE: this returns a `boolean`. A park is `RunResult`'s
    `{ kind: "parked"; prompt; cont }`, drained by `settleProgram`; a boolean carries
    neither a prompt nor a continuation, so there is nothing a resolver could drain
    and the seam stays un-parkable. It is also TOTAL — every path returns — so it
    cannot leave the caller without an answer.

    ⚠️ **THE ANNOUNCING WRAPPER AND NOT `effectRefusedOn`, WHICH IS THE PLACEMENT
    QUESTION D430 HAD TO SETTLE.** The pure predicate exists for a per-CANDIDATE
    reader that is only CONSIDERING a body (D259). The strip is not considering
    anything: it has one target, it either performs the printed act on it or it does
    not, and a refusal the player cannot see is a Tool that silently stays attached
    with no row saying why. So the seam takes the wrapper and files the same
    `ATTACK_EFFECT_PREVENTED` every other refused attack effect files. */

    ⚠️ IT IS A FILTER AND NOT A GUARD, AND THAT IS THE ONE PLACEMENT QUESTION THIS
    SLICE HAD TO SETTLE. The eight pre-existing call sites refuse the op WHOLE,
    which is right for an op with exactly one target (a status on the Active, a
    retreat lock). Crushing Hammer and Boss's Orders instead CHOOSE a target from a
    set, so refusing the op whole would mean one shielded Fraxure on a five-Pokémon
    Bench protecting the whole Bench — a rule no printing states. Filtering the
    candidate set is what "done to this Pokémon" actually says, and it falls out of
    `parkOrForce` for free: an emptied set is a whiff, a one-survivor set
    auto-resolves, anything else parks and asks.

    ⚠️ AND IT MAKES TWO PREVIOUSLY-DEAD ARMS LIVE, WHICH IS A CORRECTNESS RESULT
    AND NOT A SIDE EFFECT. D253's `preventDamageAndEffectsWhileBenched` and D254's
    `benchShieldedFromEffects` were both recorded as structurally unreachable at
    this funnel *because every op that consulted it aimed at an Active*. That
    sentence is no longer true: an ATTACK that gusts names a benched body, so a
    benched Curious Tea Party holder and a Rabsca-shielded Bench now refuse it
    through the very disjuncts written for totality two slices ago. Their doc
    blocks are corrected in place rather than left claiming a deadness that ended.

    A refusal is announced HERE rather than at the shield, so the player reads one
    row per shielded BODY and not one per Energy on it — `discardableEnergies`
    returns a candidate per uid, and three Energy on one Fraxure is one refusal. */

/** Spread damage: place `amount` HP on EACH Benched Pokémon of the side `target`
    names (§8.5 — Weakness/Resistance never apply on the Bench, so it is flat
    there). ⚠️ **D505 — `amount` ARRIVES ALREADY FOLDED.** `stepOp` passes
    `snipeAmount(op, …)` rather than `op.amount`, so the Prize-scaled printing
    (*"…for each Prize card your opponent has taken"*) reaches this function as a
    plain number and nothing below this line knows the rider exists — `damageSelf`'s
    division of labour, and the reason the early return one screen down covers the
    0-taken board for free. A benched Pokémon's own continuous damage REDUCTION still applies
    though (Bouffalant "Bouffer" / a defending Tool — the passive that is not
    Active-only), floored at 0; the attacker's pre-W/R bonus (Vitality Band) is
    Active-target-only and does NOT reach the Bench. One DAMAGE_DEALT per benched
    Pokémon (seat/uid name the DAMAGED body's owner, as everywhere). Only raises
    damage — the KO check runs in attack.ts's epilogue, so this never KOs or ends
    the game (interpreter header).

    🆕🆕 **D425 — THE VICTIM SEAT IS A PARAMETER NOW, AND EVERY LINE BELOW THAT
    NAMED "the opponent" WAS ALREADY ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTION OF THE WRONG NOUN.**
    `victim` replaces the hoisted `otherSeat(ctx.seat)`; nothing else in the body
    moved, because every prevention, reduction and shield in the fold is read off
    the DAMAGED BODY rather than off a seat. That is not a convenience — it is why
    the own-side arm needs no second copy of a 120-line pipeline:

      • the `preventDamageFrom…` family, the coin-flip shield, the §11 block, the
        Stadium and the bench shields all ask *"is THIS body protected from an
        attack by THAT card"*, and `attackerCard` is the attacker either way. A
        Mimikyu "Safeguard" standing on your OWN Bench while your own ex spreads
        into it is protected, because the printed sentence says "by attacks from
        Pokémon ex" and yours is one. The engine says so by construction.
      • `attackerDebuff` (D149/D151) is a fact about the ATTACKER — "the Defending
        Pokémon's attacks do 20 less damage" scopes the attacker and names no
        target — so it comes off the own-side splash too, unchanged.
      • `koSurvivalClamp` is asked of the damaged body, so a full-HP own benched
        holder survives its controller's own attack exactly as an opponent's does.

    🛑 **AND THE THING THIS FUNCTION STILL DOES NOT DO IS THE THING THAT MATTERS
    MOST.** It does not Knock Out, and it did not before. `finishAttack` sweeps
    `[defender, attacker]` and `collectKnockOutPass` owes each Knock Out's Prize to
    `otherSeat(entry.ref.seat)` — so an own-side spread that kills your own benched
    body hands your OPPONENT the Prize with no code written here or there.
    `ownBenchSpread.test.ts` drives that, the game end it can cause, and the fact
    that a benched Knock Out owes NO promotion; none of the three is asserted from
    this comment. */

/** Snipe: put `amount` HP of damage counters on the opponent's Benched Pokémon
    named by `refs` (the forced set, or the ones the player chose — validated
    upstream, so only refs that are the opponent's own bench slots land). Flat —
    a counter placement, NOT attack damage, so no Weakness/Resistance and no
    reduction passive (Bouffer reduces "damage from attacks", which a placed
    counter is not — the damageActive rule). One COUNTERS_PLACED per Pokémon
    actually hit. Only raises damage; the KO check runs in the caller's mid-turn
    sweep (flow.ts), so this never KOs.

    `source` IS PASSED IN, since 0.89.0 (D140). It was the string literal
    `"ability"` here until then, which was true while all three producers were
    Abilities and became a LIE the moment an attack printed the same action
    (Ting-Lu ex sv02-127 "Land Scoop"): the emitted event's `seat` OWNS the
    DAMAGED Pokémon — the attacker's opponent — rows render after their seat's
    name, and the `"ability"` log arm prints the literal word Ability. This is
    D136's finding 1 and the third time it has been refused at the source (D138's
    "moved", D139's "attack").

    ⚠️ IT IS NOT DERIVED FROM `deals`, AND THAT IS THE POINT. `deals` picks the
    EVENT (DAMAGE_DEALT vs COUNTERS_PLACED), not the provenance: its false arm is
    taken by three Abilities AND by one attack, so there is nothing to read the
    answer off. Before 0.89.0 the label was kept honest only by the accident that
    every DERIVED snipe happened to set `deals: true` — a flag chosen for an
    unrelated reason, which nothing asserted. It is asserted now
    (counterBenchPut.test.ts sweeps the whole fixture pool through the deriver and
    refuses `"ability"` on every op it produces). */

/** §9 — the two REACTIONS a damaged Active owes the Attacking Pokémon, applied at
    the interpreter's §8.5 funnel for a hit `attack.ts` no longer folds itself.
    Byte-for-byte the pair `attack.ts` runs after its own main hit, and deliberately
    so: the RECOIL is synchronous flat damage OUTSIDE the pipeline (no Weakness, no
    Resistance — the confusion-self-hit model, labelled `"counterattack"` by
    MECHANISM because the sum has lost every provenance, D141/D152), and the TRIGGER
    is a STAGE because its program can PARK (Klawf ex asks the DEFENDER which Energy
    to discard).

    ⚠️ THE STAGE IS SPLICED IN FRONT OF THE EPILOGUE, NOT APPENDED. `attack.ts` has
    already queued `[damagedTrigger?, koToolTrigger?, attackEpilogue]` before running
    the program, and `attackEpilogue` is the §8.1 sweep — so appending would run the
    reaction AFTER the Knock Out it is printed to survive ("even if this Pokémon is
    Knocked Out"), and after the `koToolTrigger` whose own doc block argues that
    "damaged" precedes "Knocked Out" in the same instant. Inserting at the first of
    those two stages puts it exactly where attack.ts would have put it. With no
    epilogue queued at all (an Ability route) there is nothing to sit in front of,
    and the append is unreachable rather than meaningful — `invokedBy` has already
    refused that caller.

    ⚠️ AND IT IS SEEDED AT MOST ONCE PER BODY. An attack whose main hit landed AND
    whose program then damages the same Active again would otherwise announce the
    Ability twice for one "is damaged"; the `pending` scan is the check, and it is a
    scan rather than a flag because `pending` is the only thing that outlives this

    🛑 **THIS IS THE SECOND, PARALLEL FOLD AND IT HAS BEEN SINCE WO-CHIEN.** The §8.5
    fold in `attack.ts` reaches the DEFENDING Active only and speaks
    `DamageCountSource`; this one reaches a CHOSEN body and speaks the op's own
    riders. `scaledAttackDamage` is not reachable from here in either sense —
    `attack.ts` imports this module, so the import would be a cycle, and its signature
    needs the attack's printed `cost` (for `extraEnergyUnitsBeyondCost`), which
    `EffectContext` does not carry. **Saying "the count reaches a new consumer" would
    be wrong: what this slice does is give the fold that already exists a second
    inhabitant.** See `damageChosen.perEnergyOnSelf` (effects.ts) for the price of
    collapsing the two riders into one `DamageCountSource` field, and for the trigger

    emits nothing). Active then bench, in index order. Never parks.

    `pokemonType` is D266's optional TYPE GATE (Clemont's Quick Wit, *"…each of
    your {L} Pokémon"*). It is a FILTER INSIDE THE LOOP and not an early return,
    because the op names a SET rather than one body: an off-type Pokémon is
    SKIPPED — as silently as an undamaged one — while its neighbours still heal.

    ⚠️ **IT IS A BOARD READ, AND IT READS THE TOP CARD.** The printed type of an
    in-play Pokémon is the type of the card on TOP of the stack (an evolved body
    is its evolution's type, not its Basic's), which is why this goes through
    `topCardOf` rather than through the `InPlayPokemon`'s own fields — the same
    datum and the same `(card?.types ?? []).includes(...)` spelling that
    `attachEnergyTargets`' `targetType` rider reads one seam over, so a board's
    "{L} Pokémon" cannot mean two things in one engine. `types` is a LIST, so a
    dual-type body satisfies either half. A card the pool cannot resolve reads as
    an EMPTY list and is REFUSED: a data gap is never healed by default.

    🆕🆕 **D461 — TWO MORE NARROWINGS, AND THEY ARE READ AT TWO DIFFERENT PLACES IN
    THIS FUNCTION BECAUSE THEY ARE TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF FACT.** `basicOnly`
    (*"each of your **Basic** Pokémon"*, 2 legal printings) is a CARD fact and so it
    is a conjunct INSIDE the walk, beside `pokemonType` and for the same reason: the
    op names a SET, so a non-Basic body is skipped as silently as an undamaged one
    while its neighbours still heal. `benchOnly` (*"each of your **Benched**
    Pokémon"*, 2) is a BOARD fact about ONE named spot, so it is not a conjunct at
    all — it decides whether the walk visits the Active, and the Active's body is
    carried through UNCHANGED when it does not.

    🛑 **THE ZERO QUESTION IS ANSWERED BY THE SHIPPED GUARD AND THIS SLICE ADDS NO
    FOURTH ONE** (D451's finding, applied). This project has three zero-shapes: a
    guard before a PARK, a whole-op `amount <= 0` refusal, and this function's
    PER-BODY `healed <= 0` skip. The right one is decided by whether the amount is
    a producer's constant or varies per body — a heal clamps to each body's OWN
    damage (`Math.min(amount, pokemon.damage)`), so it varies, and the per-body skip
    is the shipped answer. Both new riders SHRINK the set the skip runs over; they
    do not change what zero means. An EMPTY set (a `benchOnly` heal on an empty
    Bench, a `basicOnly` heal on an all-evolved side) is therefore the all-whiffed
    board with no bodies rather than a new case: zero HEALED rows, no park, no

    put 1 damage counter on each Pokémon that has an Ability (both yours and your
    opponent's), except any Froslass."*

    `healEachAll`'s walk exactly — `SEATS` in order, Active then Bench per seat,
    one event per body that actually took counters, tagged with that Pokémon's OWN
    seat rather than the controller's. The two ops are deliberately the same shape
    because they are the same printed parenthetical (*"both yours and your
    opponent's"*), and a reader comparing them should see one walk twice.

    🛑 **THE TWO PREDICATES ARE READ IN THE PRINTED ORDER AND THE SECOND IS A
    SUBTRACTION**, not a conjunction: `filter` must HOLD and `exceptNamed` must NOT
    match. A Froslass HAS an Ability, so it satisfies the noun and is then removed
    by the exemption — an `&&` of the two would counter every Froslass on the
    table, and the suite drives that exact body rather than arguing it.
    `preventOpponentPokemonPlay`'s `only`/`except` pair (continuous.ts) is the same
    subtraction one file over, and `switchActive.exceptNamed` (D273) is the same
    rider on the same axis.

    ⚠️ **AN UNRESOLVABLE TOP CARD IS SKIPPED, NEVER COUNTERED** — `matchesFilter`
    is false for `undefined`, its conservative direction, so a body whose top card
    cannot be read falls out on the FILTER line and never reaches the exemption.
    That ordering matters: reading the exemption first would let such a body
    through on `card?.name !== exceptNamed`, which is true of `undefined`.

    ⚠️ **`amount` IS ALREADY HP** (§12); the registry does the printed
    counter → HP conversion, exactly as `TREVENANT`'s `amount: 10` does, so this
    helper never sees the printed unit and cannot convert twice. `amount <= 0` is
    refused whole — the guard every placement arm carries — so a malformed row is a
    loud no-op rather than a board's worth of silent ones.

    ONLY RAISES DAMAGE, NEVER KOs: the sweep that resolves any Knock Out a placed
    counter caused belongs to the CALLER — the Checkup's for the triggered Ability
    (`runCheckupTriggers`' stable-bench-length precondition still holds, because
    nothing is removed here) and, since D450, `finishAttack`'s for the attack.
    Never parks.

    🆕🆕🆕 **D450 — THE THREE SEAMS BETWEEN AN ABILITY CALLER AND AN ATTACK ONE,
    ALL THREE OF THEM IN THIS BODY.**

    · **`op.side`** picks the seat list. `"both"` is `SEATS`, byte-for-byte the walk
      this function has always done; `"opponent"` is `otherSeat(ctx.seat)` alone,
      which is the ONLY thing corpus lines 414 and 415 needed and did not have.
      A `switch` on `spreadDamage`'s own rule (D222): a third member stops compiling
      here rather than falling out of the wrong branch of a negated test.

    · **`op.source`** rides the op instead of being hardcoded `"ability"`, D136's
      finding 1 for the fourth time on this axis (D138, D139, D140 paid for the
      first three). `log.ts`'s `COUNTERS_PLACED` switch renders `"ability"` as
      *"Ability: N damage to X"* — a row naming a mechanism an attack never used.
      ⚠️ **AND THE `"attack"` ARM'S OWN STATED REASON NARROWS HERE (D433's
      second-producer rule).** That arm says the row is SYSTEM-voiced because
      *"`seat` owns the DAMAGED Pokémon, which for an attack is the attacker's
      OPPONENT"* — no longer universal, because `side: "both"` damages the
      ATTACKER's own bodies too. The row is still right, and for a WIDER reason
      than the one written: a system row names no actor at all, so it cannot credit
      the wrong one whichever seat owns the body.

    · **§11 IS ASKED PER BODY, NOT PER OP**, through `effectRefused`'s D259 `target`
      parameter — `unshieldedRefs`' judgement reached by a walk instead of by a
      candidate list. A spread placer that refused WHOLE would let one shielded
      Fraxure protect an entire board, a rule no printing states; asking per body
      means a shield on one silences exactly one and files exactly one
      ATTACK_EFFECT_PREVENTED row. It is asked AFTER the noun, the exemption and the
      window (D433: narrow, then ask), so a body the sentence never reached files no
      prevention row. ⚠️ **AND THE ABILITY CALLER IS BYTE-IDENTICAL ACROSS THIS
      CHANGE**: `effectRefusedOn` returns `false` at `ctx.invokedBy !== "attack"`,
      and a triggered Ability leaves `invokedBy` ABSENT — so Froslass asks the gate,
      is never refused, and pushes no event. ⚠️ **AND THE OWN-SIDE HALF OF
      `side: "both"` IS ANSWERED BY THE GATE RATHER THAN BY THIS FUNCTION**:
      D430's `seat === ctx.seat` line returns `false`, because every §11 shield in
      the pool names the ATTACK'S SOURCE and the source it names is the holder's
      opponent. A Mist Energy on the attacker's own Bench does not stop the
      attacker's own sentence, and that is measured at the gate, not assumed here.

    ⚠️ **THE LOCAL IS `board` AND NOT `side`** — the op now HAS a `side`, and two
    different things under one name three lines apart is how a reader mis-attributes
    a seat (D448's naming rule, arriving as a rename rather than as a collision). */

/** 🆕🆕🆕 D451 — PUT damage counters on the opponent's bodies in `op.target` UNTIL
    each one's REMAINING HP is `op.remainingHp`. Alolan Raticate's and Palossand ex's
    sentences: *"Put damage counters on your opponent's Active Pokémon until its
    remaining HP is {10|50}."* and *"…on each of your opponent's Benched Pokémon until
    its remaining HP is 100."* (`censusAttackCorpus.ts` lines 426/427/425 — 3 sentences
    / 5 legal printings).

    🛑 **THE AMOUNT IS COMPUTED PER BODY AND THE OP CARRIES NONE.** `remaining` is
    `effectiveMaxHp − damage` — the engine's ONE definition of the printed phrase, the
    same one `remainingHpWithin` (continuous.ts) reads for the catalog's other three
    *"remaining HP"* printings — and the placement is `remaining − op.remainingHp`. So
    the maximum is the CONTINUOUS one: a Bravery Charm on a Benched body raises the
    destination it is filled to, and Gravity Mountain lowers it. The printed `hpOf`
    would get both wrong on the same board.

    🛑 **THE DISTRIBUTIVE *"its"*, WHICH IS THE WHOLE OF THE BENCH ARM.** The subtraction
    happens INSIDE the per-body closure, so each body is filled to `op.remainingHp`
    independently. There is no shared total and no `amount` to hoist — a build that
    computed one figure above the walk would place the first body's number on every
    body, and the board that shows it is a Bench whose two bodies carry different damage.

    ⚠️ **THE FLOOR IS PER BODY AND IT IS `healEachAll`'s, NOT `counterEachAll`'s.**
    Those two ops guard `amount <= 0` ONCE, above the walk, because their amount is a
    constant handed in by the producer. This one's varies per body, so the guard has to
    vary with it: a body already AT or BELOW the destination takes zero, files no
    `COUNTERS_PLACED` and leaves its neighbours alone — exactly the way an undamaged
    body heals 0 and emits nothing two ops up. Never negative.

    🛑 **IT CANNOT KNOCK ANYTHING OUT, AND `op.remainingHp <= 0` IS THE GUARD THAT MAKES
    THAT A PROPERTY OF THIS FUNCTION RATHER THAN OF TODAY'S CATALOG.** A body that takes
    counters ends at `damage = max − op.remainingHp`, which is `>= max` — i.e. lethal —
    exactly when `op.remainingHp <= 0`. Every printed destination is 10, 50 or 100, so
    the guard is unreachable from the deriver (arms 23g/23h refuse `< 1` first); it is
    written anyway for D324's reason verbatim, because the alternative is an invariant
    stated in three doc blocks and asserted by no line of code. **A future *"until its
    remaining HP is 0"* deletes this line and owes a Knock Out, a Prize and a
    `koByEffect` marker in the same slice** — this op emits none of the three, and
    `finishAttack`'s two-seat sweep (flow.ts) is the caller that would resolve one.

    ⚠️ **NO ROUNDING TO WHOLE COUNTERS.** §12 makes a counter 10 HP, but `damage` need
    not be a multiple of ten (a halved hit leaves 5) and neither need `effectiveMaxHp`
    once a Tool or a Stadium is on the board. The printed word is *"until"*, so the exact
    difference is placed and the destination is hit on the nose; `Math.ceil(x / 10) * 10`
    would overshoot past it and could reach `max`, which is the one thing this op must
    never do.

    ⚠️ **A `null` MAXIMUM PLACES NOTHING** — the catalog data gap `effectiveMaxHp` owns,
    refused in the same direction `remainingHpWithin` refuses it: an unknown maximum
    cannot be subtracted from, and a data gap is never damaged by default.

    ⚠️ **§11 IS ASKED PER BODY AND AFTER THE AMOUNT (D433: narrow, then ask).** A shield
    on one Benched body silences exactly that body and files exactly one
    ATTACK_EFFECT_PREVENTED; refusing the op whole would let one Rabsca protect a Bench,
    a rule no printing states. A body that was going to take ZERO is never asked, so a
    body the sentence did not reach files no prevention row — `counterEachAll`'s
    ordering, one op up, on a window that is arithmetic instead of a rider. */

/** PUT `amount` HP of damage counters on the OPPONENT's Active Pokémon —
    Trevenant "Forest Miasma" (a between-turns Ability, 1 counter) and, since
    0.88.0, the bare attack sentence "Put {N} damage counters on your opponent's
    Active Pokémon." (Mimikyu "Ghost Eye", Polteageist "Pour Tea" — D139).

    "Put damage counters" is NOT attack damage: no Weakness/Resistance (§8.5) AND
    no damage-reduction passive — Bouffalant's "Bouffer" reduces "damage from
    attacks", which a PLACED counter is not, whether an Ability or an attack's own
    printed sentence placed it (the same reason the poison/burn Checkup ticks
    place their counters flat). So this is a flat placement, distinct from
    spreadDamage (an ATTACK's damage, which Bouffer does reduce) — and note that
    "printed on an attack" does NOT make it attack damage, which is the one thing
    the 0.88.0 producer could have got wrong.

    `amount` IS ALREADY HP. Both producers count COUNTERS in their printed text
    and both do the × 10 (§12) at the site that reads the number, so this helper
    never sees the printed unit and cannot convert twice.

    `source` RIDES THE OP because the row's provenance is not something this
    function can know: `seat` on the emitted event owns the DAMAGED Pokémon (the
    non-actor either way), and the "ability" log arm prints the literal word
    Ability — true of Trevenant, false of Ghost Eye. Hardcoding it here was the
    shape until 0.88.0 and it was exactly D136's finding 1 waiting for a second
    producer.

    Only raises damage; the KO check runs in the CALLER's sweep — the Checkup's
    for the triggered Ability, the attack epilogue's two-seat one for the attack
    (both flow.ts) — so this never KOs. */

    on, which is on `otherSeat(ctx.seat)` by construction and may sit in EITHER
    spot — an evolve and an attach both reach the Bench, which is precisely why
    `damageActive` cannot serve this sentence.

    Out, or returned to hand, by something between the action and this op) both
    resolve to nothing — the whiff `sourceUid`'s readers already take.

    🛑 NO `effectRefused` CALL, AND THE ABSENCE IS THE CLAIM. That channel answers
    "prevent all effects of ATTACKS / of that card done to this Pokémon" (§11,
    D142/D259) and reads `ctx.invokedBy`, which is ABSENT for every trigger — so a
    call here would be a line that cannot fire on any board this catalog builds,
    i.e. green and dead. `damageActive` calls it because that op IS reached from

/** MOVE every damage counter off the controller's chosen BENCHED `ref` and onto
    the OPPONENT's Active — Dedenne ex sv02-093/-239 "Tail Swap" (D138). One
    printed action, two halves, and the SAME number in both: `HEALED` for what
    came off (so the bench body lands at exactly 0) and `COUNTERS_PLACED` source
    "moved" for what went on. That equality is the word "move"; two different
    numbers would be a heal and a snipe wearing one sentence.

    THE ORDER IS THE PRINTED ORDER — "from … to …" — and it is also the only
    order that reads correctly in a log, since the second row is the one that can
    Knock the defender Out.

    A PLACED COUNTER, NOT ATTACK DAMAGE (`damageActive`'s rule verbatim): no
    Weakness/Resistance (§8.5) and no `damageReductionAfterWR` passive, because
    Bouffalant's "Bouffer" reduces *damage from attacks* and a moved counter is
    not one. So the number on the defender is the number that came off the Bench,
    whatever the defender is weak to.

    THREE ENDINGS, all silent and all reachable:
      • the `ref` is not the controller's own Bench — the wire belt (`candidates`
        is the real legality rule, and it only ever holds own-bench refs);
      • the pick carries NO damage — a whiff, and the printed sentence offers
        undamaged bodies on purpose (the Potion doctrine), so this is the single-
        arm rule: nothing moved, so nothing is announced;
      • there is no Defending Pokémon — then NOTHING moves, not even the removal.
        A move needs both ends, and half of one would silently launder counters
        off the controller's board. Unreachable from a §8 attack (the attack gate
        guarantees a defender) and written down because a total helper must still
        answer it.

    Like every op it only RAISES damage and never KOs: the attack epilogue's
    two-seat sweep (flow.ts `finishAttack`) reads the post-effect board, prizes to
    the attacker and promotes — after a park just as much as inline, because
    `resumeTail` keeps `attackEpilogue` queued behind the question (D135). */

    MUST take both or neither, and one write site is the only way those two
    invariants can stay true of both sentences at once.

    THE §11 GATE IS CONDITIONAL HERE AND UNCONDITIONAL AT THE CALLER, WHICH IS
    NOT A SOFTENING. `attackEffectRefused` asks one question — *is a wide
    `{effects: true}` block live on this seat's **ACTIVE**?* — and a §11 block is
    an Active-Spot fact by construction (`clearOnLeavingActive`). So asking it
    about a BENCHED destination is asking about a body it does not describe, and
    answering "refused" there would refuse a move the printed block never
    touched, on the evidence of a completely different Pokémon. The gate is
    therefore consulted exactly when the destination IS an Active — which for
    `moveCountersToDefender` is always, so its behaviour is byte-identical.

    The seat handed to the gate is the DESTINATION's, not `otherSeat(ctx.seat)`.
    Both printings aim at the opponent, so the two are the same value today;
    reading it off the destination is what keeps the gate describing the body

    rejects a hand play with `EVOLVE_MISMATCH` unless

    exactly that equality, so the two routes onto a stack cannot come to disagree

    should be: the printed sentence carries no stage word, no name and no count —
    Team Rocket's Pupitar `sv10-095` is a **Stage 1** running it, which is the
    printing that proves the rule is the chain and not "a Basic evolving".

    ⚠️ **THE TWO §10 TIMING BANS DO NOT APPLY AND THAT IS THE PRINT, NOT AN
    OMISSION.** `turn.ts` refuses an evolve when the target `turnPlayed >=
    state.turn` (§10's "came into play this turn") and during the first turn (§4)
    — both are rules about **playing a Pokémon from your hand**, which this
    sentence is not doing. Exeggcute's own registry gate (`firstTurnExempt`,
    D281/D282) exists because the *attack* needed licensing on turn one, and it

    having filled in between.

    ⚠️ **THE EVENT FIRES EVEN WHEN NOTHING MOVED (D241).** This used to
    `return state` on an empty `moved`, which made the DECLINE silent — the
    player looked at the top `n`, learned it, put it all back, and the opponent
    was told nothing. The look is the announcement; the move is only its
    consequence.

    `reveal` is the op's printed *"you may reveal a … you find there"* rider
    (D225), forwarded onto the event for the log exactly as searchMove forwards
    its own. The FUNCTION's name is about the deck top being revealed to its
    owner — the same thing the event name means, and the ambiguity that let the
    old comment claim a reveal the row never printed.

    🆕 ⚠️ **D334 — `restTo` MOVES THE LEFTOVERS, AND IT RUNS ON EVERY PATH
    INCLUDING THE ONES THAT MOVE NOTHING** (Explorer's Guidance's printed *"Discard
    the other cards"*, then D335's two more destinations). `attachFromTopApply`'s
    rule, transferred verbatim rather than re-derived: the clause is a cost the card
    charges whether the look found anything or not, so `stepOp`'s empty branch is
    routed HERE with no picks instead of returning early, and one apply is what keeps
    a branch from forgetting it.

    🆕🆕 🛑 **D335 — THREE DESTINATIONS, ONE OF THEM AN EVENT AND TWO OF THEM NOT.**
    `"discard"` is the only value whose cards LEAVE the deck, so it is the only one
    that pushes `DECK_TOP_DISCARDED` — the event's own qualifying test, applied
    rather than counted. `"bottom"` (Drakloak's *"Put the other card on the bottom of
    your deck"*) and `"shuffledBottom"` (Rika's *"Shuffle the other cards and put
    them on the bottom of your deck"*) append the window's leftovers UNDER the deck
    and announce nothing: the cards never changed zone, and `DECK_TOP_REVEALED` above
    has already told both seats a look happened. See effects.ts for why
    `CARD_TO_BOTTOM_OF_DECK` (singular, hand-sourced, named because the hand was
    revealed) and `SHUFFLE` (a claim about the whole deck) are both refused here.

    ⚠️ **`"shuffledBottom"` IS THE ONLY VALUE THAT SPENDS `rngState`, AND IT SPENDS
    IT ONLY WHEN THERE IS SOMETHING TO RANDOMIZE** — `shuffle` runs its
    Fisher–Yates loop from `length - 1` down while `i > 0`, so a one-card or empty
    leftover consumes no draws and a replay of a v-19-era board is untouched by the
    branch existing. The order for `"bottom"` is the WINDOW's own (deck order, top
    first), which is the only order the print names and the only one that needs no
    randomness; Drakloak's leftover is a single card, so no printed board can tell
    that convention from any other — it is written down so the next author does not
    have to guess it.

    🛑 **THE LEFTOVERS ARE `window \ moved`, NOT `candidates \ moved`.** The
    printed "other cards" are every card the player LOOKED AT and did not take —
    including the ones no filter admitted, which were never candidates at all. The
    window is re-read off the LIVE deck here for `searchMove`'s wire-safety reason
    and because a park is answered later; deck order, top first, which is the order
    the pile gains them (§2).

    🛑 **AND THE BENCH CLAMP FEEDS THE LEFTOVERS RATHER THAN STRANDING CARDS.** A
    pick that could not land (a full Bench) is not moved, so it stays in the window
    and is discarded like any other card the player did not take — which is the only
    reading that keeps "the set removed from the deck is exactly the set that lands"
    true with two destinations in play. No printing pairs `dest: "bench"` with any
    `restTo` today; the arm is written this way so that it cannot destroy a card the
    day one does — and under `"bottom"`/`"shuffledBottom"` the unplaceable pick is
    put back under the deck rather than lost, which is the same guarantee one
    destination over. */

    hiding what the effect just showed (events.ts).

    TWO PRODUCERS SINCE D232 — `bottomFromOpponentHand`'s opening line and the
    standalone `revealOpponentHand` op — and they share this function rather than
    each pushing their own literal. The hazard is not the event's shape but its
    CONTENT: a second copy is free to drift on which seat's hand it reads
    (`ctx.seat` versus its opposite is one character), and a crossed reveal would
    show a player their OWN hand while telling the log it was the opponent's. The
    caller passes the OWNER, so the seat question is answered once per call site
    and never inside this function.

    THE ARRAY IS COPIED. `side.hand` lives in the state the caller is about to
    keep threading, and an event holding a live reference would retro-actively
    change what the log says was revealed the moment a later op moved a card out
    of that hand — the same freshness rule `recordMoved` states one screen up.

    ⚠️ EMITS FOR AN EMPTY HAND TOO (zero uids), and no caller may skip that: the
    log has a row for it ("revealed their hand — no cards"), and BOTH ops here can
    reach an empty opponent hand from an attack — the play gate that keeps the
    TRAINER path off it (cardplay.ts) has no jurisdiction over §8. */

    where the printed sentence says: their own discard pile ("Discard a random
    card from your opponent's hand.") or back into their deck, shuffled ("…Your
    opponent reveals that card and shuffles it into their deck.").

    **THE PICK IS `randomIndex` OVER THE LIVE HAND, WHICH IS THE WHOLE SEED
    ARGUMENT.** `state.rngState` is a field of `GameState`, `MatchRecord`
    persists the whole `GameState`, and every consumer of the RNG in this engine
    advances that one integer — so this pick replays exactly, an online match
    resumed from storage picks the card it already picked, and no
    `MATCH_RECORD_VERSION` move is owed (match.ts). Asked BEFORE the op was
    written, because `Math.random()` here would have been correct-looking and
    would have desynced replay silently.

    **AN EMPTY HAND TAKES NOTHING, EMITS NOTHING AND ADVANCES NOTHING** — three
    claims held by TWO guards doing DIFFERENT jobs, which is a correction a mutant
    made to this paragraph rather than a design stated up front. The draft said the
    length test here existed to stop the RNG burn and that `randomIndex`'s own
    `count <= 0` return was belt-and-braces; mutating this line to burn a step
    produced an EQUIVALENT mutant, because the other guard already answered. The
    true division:
      · `randomIndex(0, s) === [0, s]` is what stops the BURN — a whiff that took
        a step would make two replays that did the same thing diverge on the next
        coin flip, and nothing about the board would show it.
      · THIS line is what stops the bogus EVENT. Without it `side.hand[0]` is
        `undefined` and the op announces a take of a card that does not exist,
        which the log then tries to name.
    Both are pinned by their own mutant, and neither substitutes for the other.

    **THE `deck` ROUTE SHUFFLES, AND THE SHUFFLE IS AN EVENT.** The card is
    appended and the whole deck reordered — the `shuffleDeck` op's own contract,
    on the OWNER's seat — so the position is genuinely gone. Naming the card in
    `RANDOM_CARD_TAKEN` and then losing its position is exactly the printed pair
    of facts ("reveals that card" / "shuffles it into their deck"), and a build
    that skipped the shuffle would leave a known card sitting on top of a deck the
    owner is about to draw from.

    `actor` is the controller, `seat` the owner of the hand and the destination —
    the CARD_TO_BOTTOM_OF_DECK precedent, and the reason the log can phrase this
    from either side of the table without a possessive. */

    Pokémon") off the board with every card attached to it and shuffle the whole
    pile into its controller's deck.

    🛑 **THE ONE THING IT DOES THAT `returnBenched` CANNOT: IT REACHES THE ACTIVE
    SPOT.** The bench arm is that function's splice byte for byte (the same
    compaction, §8.1's "no gap, no promotion" being a fact about the BENCH); the
    active arm sets `active` to `null` and leaves a spot the board owes a
    promotion for. **That promotion is NOT queued here** — this returns a
    `GameState` and the stage queue is `flow.ts`'s — it is swept for by
    `resolveMidTurnKnockOuts` after the program settles, which is also what makes
    the §14.2 loss (last Pokémon shuffled away) fall out with no code.

    ⚠️ **THE OWNER IS `ctx.seat`, NOT the ref's seat, and here those are the same
    thing by construction** — `sourceRef` only ever looks at the controller's own
    board, because "this Pokémon" is the body running the program.

    ⚠️ **NO REF AND NO STACK IS A SILENT NO-OP**, `returnBenched`'s three guards
    verbatim: the body was evolved over, bounced or Knocked Out earlier in the same
    program, and the printed pronoun then points at nothing.

    Reuses `POKEMON_RETURNED` — the movement, the pile and (on the deck arm) the
    shuffle are identical, and a second event naming the same movement would make
    one fact two log rows (D299's own reason for one event across two boards).

    🆕 🛑 **D313 — THREE ZONES AND ONE SPLIT, AND THE WHOLE OF IT IS A PARTITION OF
    `stackUids`.** `op.dest` (absent = `"deck"`, the v18 wire reading) is where the
    BODY PILE goes; `op.attachmentsTo` is the one printed departure from it. The two
    piles are `body.stack` (the evolution cards — a bounced Crobat ex takes its
    Golbat and Zubat with it) and `body.energy` + `body.tools` (what the printed
    parenthetical calls *"all cards attached to this Pokémon"*), which is exactly
    the join `stackUids` concatenates, so the split costs no new extraction.

    ⚠️ **THE ZONES ARE GATHERED BEFORE THEY ARE APPLIED, AND THAT IS WHAT KEEPS THE
    DECK ARM HONEST.** Placing the two piles one at a time would shuffle twice (two
    RNG draws, two SHUFFLE rows) on the three printings where both piles go to the
    deck. Gathering first means the deck is touched AT MOST ONCE — one `shuffle`,
    one event — and a printing that sends nothing to the deck emits no SHUFFLE at
    all, which is the same "one event per thing that happened" rule the event's own
    block states.

    ⚠️ **`uids` ON THE EVENT STAYS THE WHOLE PILE** (the KNOCKED_OUT precedent), and
    `attachmentsTo` on the event carries BOTH the zone and the subset that went
    there. One field rather than two because a zone with no cards is unreadable and
    cards with no zone are unattributable: they are only ever true together, so a

    🛑 **§11 IS A FILTER AND NOT A GUARD, WHICH IS D259's RULE AND NOT A CHOICE.**
    The sentence names a SET, so a shielded body must merely not be devolved — refusing
    the op whole would let one Mist-Energy'd Fraxure protect the entire board, a rule no
    printing states. `unshieldedRefs` is the same funnel `gust`, `returnBenched` and
    `knockOutChosen` already apply, and it announces one `ATTACK_EFFECT_PREVENTED` per
    shielded BODY rather than one for the sweep.

    🛑 **THE CLEAR SET IS THE §10/§11 ELEVEN, AND THE THREE FIELDS `evolveOnto`
    ALSO WRITES ARE DECIDED SEPARATELY BECAUSE THEY SAY SOMETHING ELSE.** The eleven —
    `conditions` through `boostedAttack` below — are byte-for-byte the set `switchInto`
    (interpreter.ts) and `clearOnLeavingActive` (turn.ts) clear, and §12 names
    devolution in the same breath as evolution (*"retreats / moves to Bench, evolves,
    devolves, or by card effect"*, `docs/reference/ptcg-rules.md` §12). `evolveOnto`
    writes THREE more, and all three of those say *a new card arrived*:

      · `turnPlayed` — **KEPT**. Nothing came into play; the body has been here since it
        was played. A devolved Pokémon that could not be evolved again on its
        controller's next turn would be a rule no card prints.
      · `markers` — **KEPT**, and this is the one that would be a live defect if copied
        from `evolveOnto`. The only marker in the engine is D414's `koByEffect:<turn>`,
        which records that a body's LETHALITY is not damage's doing; clearing it here
        would silently restore the *"Knocked Out by damage from an attack"* reading for
        a body §8.1 is about to collect. `switchInto` and `clearOnLeavingActive` keep it
        too — the three shipped literals already DISAGREE about this field, and the
        disagreement is right: it is cleared only where a fresh card arrives.
      · `evolvedTurn` — **NULLED**, the one write here that is neither the eleven nor a
        keep. It is a fact ABOUT THE CARD THAT JUST LEFT, so it must not outlive it.
        `null` rather than a stale number because the field's only reader asks
        `=== state.turn` (Gholdengo `sv08-131`'s +90): under-claiming is invisible and
        over-claiming pays a bonus to a body that is no longer the Pokémon which earned
        it. No board in this catalog can currently witness the difference — devolution
        happens on the OPPONENT's turn, so `evolvedTurn === state.turn` is already false
        for every body this op can reach — so it is pinned by a surgery, exactly as
        `evolveOnto` pins its own unreachable clears.

    Damage, Energy and Tools carry over untouched: §10's carry-over read in the other
    direction, and the damage half is what makes the Knock Out below possible at all.

    🛑 **THE KNOCK OUT ARRIVES BY THE MAXIMUM MOVING, §8.1 NEEDS NO NEW MECHANISM
    — BUT THE *CAUSE* DOES.** `isLethallyDamaged` is a `damage >= effectiveMaxHp` STATE
    check and `effectiveMaxHp` resolves the stack TOP live, so a Stage 2 carrying 100
    damage that devolves to a 90 HP Stage 1 is lethal the instant the stack shortens —
    no damage dealt, no counter placed. `finishAttack`'s `collectKnockOuts` sweeps both
    boards after the program settles and collects it; the Prize and the promotion fall
    out with no code. What §8.1 does NOT get right by itself is *"Knocked Out **by
    damage** from an attack"* — read by four built sentences / six printings through
    `KnockOutMark.byAttack`, and by `koRecoilOf` for Vengeful Punch `sv03-197`.
    `collectKnockOuts`' own comment already states the rule this op needs: *"a cascade
    Knock Out is caused by the maximum MOVING, not by the attack's damage"*. So a body
    this op makes lethal is stamped with D414's `koByEffect:<turn>` marker — the SECOND
    producer of that stamp, and the first that writes it without writing damage.

    ⚠️ **THE STAMP IS CONDITIONED ON `wasLethal`, AND THAT CONJUNCT IS THE PRECISION OF
    IT.** §8.5's damage lands BEFORE the effect program runs (D125), so the Defending
    Pokémon can already be lethal when this op reaches it. That body WAS Knocked Out by
    damage from an attack, and stamping it would deny Vengeful Punch a recoil it is
    owed. Only a body that crosses the line BECAUSE the maximum moved is marked.

    ⚠️ **THE `wasLethal` READ AND THE RE-READ STRADDLE THE WRITE, DELIBERATELY.**
    `effectiveMaxHp` → `seatMaxHpBonus` locates the body by matching its TOP UID against
    the bodies IN PLAY, so asking about a devolved body that has not been written back
    yet answers 0 for every seat-wide HP aura — a silently wrong maximum on exactly the
    boards this op is interesting on. The devolved bodies are therefore committed to the
    board FIRST and the lethality question asked of the COMMITTED state (D428/D429's
    stale-local hazard, arriving through a helper's lookup rather than through a
    `const`).

    ⚠️ **AND THE SIBLING GAP IS NAMED RATHER THAN PINNED (D429).** This is not the only
    op that can drop a maximum below a body's existing damage: `discardStadium` (D380)
    can vacate Lively Stadium's `+30` to every Basic, and `discardTool` can take a
    Bravery Charm off. Neither stamps, so both currently report a max-moved Knock Out as
    *"by damage from an attack"*. That is a REAL inconsistency and it PREDATES this
    slice; it is recorded here so the next reader finds it, and deliberately NOT covered
    by a test, because a guard asserting today's answer would redden when someone fixes
    it.

    ⚠️ **ONE `SHUFFLE` FOR THE WHOLE SWEEP**, `returnSelf`'s stated rule: the cards are
    gathered and the deck is touched at most once, so three devolutions file three
    `POKEMON_DEVOLVED` rows and ONE `SHUFFLE`, and a board with nothing evolved on it
    files neither — a silent no-op, every sibling's contract. The RNG draw count is part
    of that contract: a per-body shuffle would advance `rngState` a different number of
    times and desynchronise every later flip.

    ⚠️ **THE DECK IS THE OWNER'S**, `returnBenched`'s and `randomFromOpponentHand`'s
    line: every zone touched belongs to the body, and `ctx.seat` reaches only the
    event's `actor`. */

    and Dusknoir "Cursed Blast", 6 legal printings on 2 sentences).
    🆕 **D346 — Magneton "Overvolt Discharge" ×3 joins them, so this op now reads
    ALL NINE legal printings of its clause on all THREE sentences.** This line said
    Magneton "owes a second mechanism"; it owed none, and the op licensed the third
    sentence on the day it shipped.

    🛑 **IT MARKS RATHER THAN KILLS, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN.** §8.1's sweep
    is `lethalRefs` → `planPrizes` → `knockOut`, and it is reached by THREE callers
    (the attack epilogue, the Checkup, `resolveMidTurnKnockOuts`). Killing the body
    here would need a fourth copy of the Prize plan, the whole-stack discard, the
    `KNOCKED_OUT` emit and the §8.1 promotion — all four of which are already owed
    to this program by `settleProgram`. So the op writes the ONE thing the sweep
    reads (`damage >= effectiveMaxHp`) and stops. `returnSelf`'s doc makes the same
    argument for the empty-Active seam; this is the SECOND consumer of it and the
    first that pays a Prize.

    ⚠️ **`effectiveMaxHp` IS READ AT THE MOMENT THE OP RUNS**, which is the printed
    reading: an HP aura (Ludicolo `sv09-037`) that is on the board when Cursed
    Blast resolves raises the number this op must meet, and one that arrives
    afterwards cannot un-Knock-Out a body §8.1 has already collected. `null`
    (no printed HP) is a body no rule can Knock Out by a state check, and
    `isLethallyDamaged` answers false for it — so the op whiffs there rather than
    inventing a number, and the whiff is unreachable in the catalog (every carrier
    is a Pokémon with printed HP).

    ⚠️ **NO EVENT.** The marking is invisible by construction: the body is removed
    inside the same reduction, so no projection can ever observe the damage this
    writes, and `KNOCKED_OUT` (fired by `knockOut` a moment later) is the honest
    row. A `COUNTERS_PLACED` here would say the host took counters, which is
    exactly what the printed clause is not.

    body that is neither its own host nor an Active: *"Knock Out 1 of your
    opponent's **Benched** Basic Pokémon"*.

    §8.1's sweep is `lethalRefs` → `planPrizes` → `knockOut` and it is reached by

    the whole-stack discard, the `KNOCKED_OUT` emit and the §8.1 promotion, ALL of
    which `settleProgram` already owes this program. So this writes the ONE thing
    the sweep reads (`damage >= effectiveMaxHp`) and stops.

    ⚠️ **`marker` IS THE ONE POLICY DIFFERENCE THAT LIVES IN HERE, AND §11 IS
    DELIBERATELY NOT THE OTHER ONE.** D414's `koByEffect:<turn>` stamp says the
    lethality is NOT DAMAGE — read by `flow.ts`'s `byAttackFor` and by
    `koRecoilOf`. `knockOutSelf` omits it (its own host, no cross-table claim);
    the two opponent-side ops pass it. The §11 ask (`effectRefused`, D142) does
    NOT ride this parameter, because the two callers that owe it ask in two
    STRUCTURALLY different places and a flag cannot express both:
    `knockOutDefender` names ONE body and refuses the op WHOLE, while
    `knockOutChosen` picks from a SET and must merely not OFFER a shielded body —
    which is `unshieldedRefs`' FILTER (D259: *"a filter and not a guard"*), applied
    at the funnel where `gust` and `returnBenched` already apply it. An ask in here
    would be a second announcement on the guard path and an unreachable branch on
    the filter path.

    ⚠️ **A BODY WITH NO PRINTED HP IS A WHIFF, NOT A THROW** — `effectiveMaxHp`
    owns that catalog gap and `isLethallyDamaged` answers false for such a body, so
    marking it would produce a corpse §8.1 never collects. Unreachable in the
    catalog (every carrier is a Pokémon with printed HP) and written anyway,
    because inventing a maximum is the worse of the two failures.

    ⚠️ **THE STAMP IS IDEMPOTENT**: a program that dooms an already-doomed body in
    the same turn re-computes the same string and adds no duplicate.

    🆕🆕 **D435 — A FOURTH CALLER, AND THE FIRST FROM OUTSIDE AN EFFECT PROGRAM.**
    `runCheckup` (flow.ts) fires the delayed KNOCK-OUT payload of the D434/D435
    schedule through this function, which is why it is exported. It passes the
    `koByEffect` marker under D433's `wasLethal` conjunct — re-derived at that site
    rather than inherited from any of the three callers here, since its lethality is

    resumes. Nothing here re-implements any of that; D329 lifted the §14 evaluation to
    a single point on purpose, and a second one is how two answers start disagreeing.

    🛑 **THE SEAT IS `ctx.seat` — THE PLAYER WHOSE CARD PRINTED THE SENTENCE.** Every
    other producer of this stage is `knockOut`, which is handed `otherSeat(koedSeat)`,
    so the stage's `seat` has always meant "the player who did NOT lose the body".
    Reading that as an invariant and writing `otherSeat(ctx.seat)` here would hand the
    OPPONENT the prize on every board — a defect no census and no coverage figure can
    see, because the sentence would still be BUILT and the stage would still resolve.
    It is a mutant row (`D431-take-prize-wrong-seat`).

    🛑 **THE CLOSED-WORLD AUDIT, BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST PRIZE WITHOUT A KNOCK OUT
    (D425/D414).** Every consumer of the `takePrizes` stage was read for facts it
    DERIVES rather than READS, and the enumeration is `grep -rn '"takePrizes"'` over
    every `.ts`/`.tsx` outside `node_modules` — **15 hits, all read**, not the four the
    slice was priced with:
      · `flow.ts` `knockOut` ×2 — the two PRODUCERS, untouched;
      · `flow.ts` `advance` — reads `stage.seat` and `stage.count`, derives nothing;
      · `flow.ts` `collectKnockOutPass` and `tiedOverTheBatch` — both quantify over the
        stages of THEIR OWN batch, never over `state.pending`, so a stage this op
        queued is invisible to them by construction (and is already RESOLVED by the
        time `attackEpilogue` runs it, which is what the splice below guarantees);
      · `attack.ts` `takePrizes` — cross-checks the head stage against the phase and
        reads `seat`/`count` off it;
      · `types.ts`, `actions.ts`, `phaseView.ts` ×2, `redact.ts`, `projection.ts`,
        `GameHud.tsx` ×2, `OnlineHud.tsx` — counts and seats, carried through.
    **NOTHING infers "a KO happened", "a body left play" or "the other seat lost a
    Pokémon" from the presence of this stage.** The nearest thing to a derivation is
    `phaseView.ts`'s `koParkActiveSeat`, which reads `state.pending` to decide whether
    a ko:* park sits INSIDE a turn — and it already names `attackEpilogue`, the stage
    this park is spliced in front of, for the effect-program case. So it answers
    "inside the attacker's turn" here, which is the truth. Driven, not assumed, in
    `takePrizeAttack.test.ts` §7.

    🛑 **SPLICED AHEAD OF THE ATTACK'S QUEUED TAIL, NOT APPENDED.** `attack.ts` queues
    `[damagedTrigger?, koToolTrigger?, attackEpilogue]` BEFORE it runs the program, so
    an append would take this prize AFTER the §8.1 Knock Out sweep and after the turn
    had ended. The position is not a preference: **every other op in this file finishes
    its work synchronously — i.e. before ANY of those three stages runs — and this one
    is a stage only because WHICH face-down prize is a decision a player must make.**
    So it goes where the work would have happened had it needed no answer: in front of
    the whole tail. (`reactToAttackDamage` splices for a different reason — its stage
    must precede a Knock Out it is printed to survive — and in front of a two-member
    set; the shapes are deliberately not shared.)

    ⚠️ **WHICH MAKES THE ORDER AGAINST A KNOCK OUT FROM THE SAME ATTACK EXPLICIT, AND
    IT IS §8.1's OWN.** An attack that prints this clause AND Knocks the Defender out
    queues **two** `takePrizes` stages: this one, then the sweep's from inside
    `attackEpilogue`. They are not one batch and must not be merged — this prize is
    step 4 of the attack, which PRECEDES the Knock Out check, while the sweep's prize
    is the Knock Out's own. So printed order and §8.1 order agree, the attacker answers
    two prompts in that sequence, and if the FIRST one empties the row the game ends
    before the second is ever offered (`resolvePrizesAndResume`'s win check). Driven in
    `takePrizeAttack.test.ts` §5.

    ⚠️ **WITH NO TAIL QUEUED THE APPEND IS THE ANSWER, AND IT IS UNREACHABLE TODAY.**
    The op's only producer is `deriveAttackEffect`'s D431 arm, which runs only from
    `attack()`, so the `-1` branch needs an Ability or Trainer program carrying this op
    and none exists. It is written as the honest ending rather than a throw because
    `settleProgram`'s other routes drain `pending` too, so a future Ability route works
    unchanged — but the branch is declared as an `unreachable-population` survivor in
    the mutant corpus rather than tested around (D205).

    ⚠️ **NO CLAMP AND NO WIN CHECK HERE, DELIBERATELY.** A seat with an empty prize row
    has already won, and `advance`'s own arm pops a stage whose clamped count is 0
    rather than parking on a row it cannot fill — its comment says so and
    `takePrizeAttack.test.ts` §6 pins it. Asking either question here would be a second
    answer to a question that already has exactly one. */

    is the seat the printed sentence addresses. Here it is not: the card says

    at this dialog **IS** that opponent. A verbatim caption would tell them to make

    second seat for the row to name, and the function does not take one.

    ⚠️ **WHAT MOVED, NOT WHAT WAS ASKED FOR** — `payFromHandApply`'s membership and
    duplicate filter, byte for byte. Both callers already hold a subset of the live
    hand (the forced arm passes the hand itself; the parked one passes a
    validator-checked answer), so the filter is a belt — and it is the belt that
    keeps the EVENT honest if either of those two facts ever stops being true.

    ⚠️ **AN EMPTY RESULT EMITS NOTHING.** `payFromHandApply`'s `paid.length === 0`

    something that did not happen. The op's own empty-hand branch means this is

    TOP-LEVEL ops — no printed card puts a cost inside a coin or condition gate,
    and a cost that could be skipped by a branch would not be a cost.

    NOT COMPOSITIONAL, and the limit is exactly one cost per program. Each op is
    checked against the SAME starting hand, so a hypothetical program with two
    costs would pass the gate on a hand that can only pay one, and the second
    would then resolve free (the short-hand branch in `stepOp` pays what there
    is). Every printed card in the family charges once — the cost is the price of
    a play, and a play happens once — so this is a scope statement, not a bug;

    three refusals are unreachable from an authored row (`validateChoice` matches
    the wire answer against the PROMPT, and a Trainer play always has an Active),

/** 🆕 D331 — the bodies a `gust` may drag up on the OPPONENT's board: their whole
    Bench, narrowed by the printed stage word when the card spells one.

    🛑 **EXPORTED FOR `programPlayable` (cardplay.ts), AND THAT EXPORT IS THE
    POINT OF THE FUNCTION RATHER THAN A CONVENIENCE.** Until this slice the gate
    over there read `state.players[otherSeat(seat)].bench.length === 0` — a raw
    bench LENGTH, which is `oppBenchRefs` only while no printing narrows the set.
    Lisia's Appeal `sv08-179`/`-234`/`-246` narrows it, so a rider honoured in the
    interpreter and not in the gate would have offered a prompt with no candidates
    on a Bench of pure Evolutions, after spending the turn's one Supporter (§7.2).
    That is exactly what D206 fixed for `switchActive` — *"the op's own candidate
    function answers instead … so the refusal and the offer can never disagree"* —
    and `switchActiveTargets`' doc states the same rule as a house invariant: one
    SOLE FUNNEL, asked by both readers.

    ⚠️ **IT IS BEHAVIOUR-PRESERVING FOR EVERY PRINTING THAT SHIPPED BEFORE IT.**
    With `basicOnly` absent this returns `oppBenchRefs` unfiltered, whose `.length`
    IS the bench length the old gate read, so Boss's Orders, Pokémon Catcher,
    Prime Catcher, Giovanni's consequent and Florges' coin-gated gust all keep
    their exact candidate sets and their exact playability.

    ⚠️ **THE SHIELD IS DELIBERATELY NOT IN HERE.** `unshieldedRefs` takes `ctx` and
    `events` because it ANNOUNCES each refusal it makes, and `programPlayable` is a
    pure question with neither — so the shield stays wrapped around the call site,
    exactly where `returnBenched` keeps it. This funnel answers "which bodies does
    the CARD name", not "which of them may be touched right now"; those are two
    questions and only the first one is printed. */

    SPELLING AND NOT A STYLE CHOICE.** Three sites in `attack.ts` already convert

    the two readings agree on a board where damage is not a clean multiple of ten —
    a 65-damage body carries SIX counters, and an `=== 60` window would answer NO to
    a sentence the print answers YES to.

    the *"N HP or less remaining"* window `gust.remainingHpAtMost` reads — but that
    predicate lives over there because it needs `state`: `effectiveMaxHp` folds HP
    auras and Tools, so the answer moves with the whole board. This one is a pure
    function of ONE body's own `damage` field, reads no passive, takes no seat and
    cannot disagree with anything continuous.ts aggregates. Putting a state-free
    read in the state-dependent module would say the two are the same kind of

    narrowing rather than per BOARD as a gate.

    🛑 **`damage > 0` AND NOT `damageCountersOn(pokemon) >= 1`, AND THE PRECEDENT IS
    UNANIMOUS RATHER THAN NEAREST.** Five shipped `conditionHolds` arms already read
    this exact printed phrase — `opponentActiveDamaged`, `yourActiveDamaged`,
    `yourBenchDamaged`, `yourBenchAllDamaged`, `yourBenchNamedDamaged` — and every
    one of the five spells it `p.damage > 0`, with the first saying so outright in
    its own comment (*"Damage is HP on the model, so 'any counters' is `> 0`"*).
    `damageCountersOn` directly above is not a disagreeing sibling: it exists for a
    phrase whose comparand is a NUMBER (*"exactly 6 damage counters"*), where the
    unit has to be counters or `65` damage answers a question the print answers the
    other way. D436's rule — **the comparand fixes the unit** — sends *"any"* to the
    presence test and *"exactly N"* to the count. Following the structurally nearest
    neighbour instead of the phrase's own five would have been D433's `markers`
    mistake at a predicate.

    ⚠️ **THE TWO SPELLINGS DIFFER ON EXACTLY ONE CLASS OF BOARD — 1 to 9 damage —
    AND THAT BOARD IS NOT REACHABLE IN PLAY**, which is measured rather than assumed:
    every writer of `InPlayPokemon.damage` in this file adds or subtracts a printed
    amount or a catalog HP figure (`koSurvivalClamp`'s `hp - 10`), all multiples of
    ten, and the engine has no halving, rounding or percentage damage anywhere. It is
    still constructible as a FIXTURE, and `filteredBenchSnipe.test.ts` drives it, so
    the choice is pinned by a rung rather than left to a comment: a 5-damage body IS
    a candidate here, and a `damageCountersOn(p) >= 1` build would drop it.

    ⚠️ Its home is beside `damageCountersOn` for that function's own stated reason:
    a pure read of ONE body's `damage` field, no `state`, no seat, no passive — the
    line that keeps it out of continuous.ts, where `remainingHpWithin` lives because
    it folds HP auras. And it is a NAMED READER rather than an inline predicate at
    `snipeTargets` for D222's: the day a second sentence prints this phrase over a
    candidate set, there is one place for it to ask. */

    the op's predicate and drifted; this one is written as a funnel FROM THE FIRST
    COMMIT, which is the same rule stated forwards instead of paid for backwards.

    🛑 **THE SCOPE LINE IS `snipeTargets`' VERBATIM.** `opponentBench` →
    `oppBenchRefs`, `opponentAny` → `oppAnyRefs` (Active first, then the Bench in
    index order), which is exactly why `target` reuses `damageChosen`'s two member
    names rather than coining new ones: two vocabularies over one pair of helpers
    is two chances to disagree about what "any" includes.

    ⚠️ **THE RIDERS COMPOSE AND NEITHER IS PRINTED WITH THE OTHER TODAY.** The
    counter window is applied FIRST and separately because it reads the BODY
    (`refPokemon`) while `basicOnly` reads the CARD (`refTopCard`) — `gustTargets`'
    own split, for its own stated reason. A ref that resolves to no body or no card
    is DROPPED rather than admitted: a narrowed sentence must not offer a body it
    cannot read.

    ⚠️ **THE SHIELD IS DELIBERATELY NOT IN HERE**, `gustTargets`' rule verbatim:
    `unshieldedRefs` takes `ctx` and `events` because it ANNOUNCES each refusal, and
    this function answers *"which bodies does the CARD name"* — not *"which of them
    may be touched right now"*. Two questions; only the first is printed.

    ⚠️ **EXPORTED, THOUGH `programPlayable` DOES NOT CALL IT — AND THE ABSENCE IS
    STATED RATHER THAN LEFT TO BE NOTICED.** Both producers are ATTACKS, and attacks
    never consult that gate (§8), so a line beside the `gust` / `damageChosen` /
    `healChosen` ones would be dead today. It is exported anyway so that the day a

    live answer, not an error, in two honest ways: the context carries no source
    at all (a Trainer program authored with `toSelf` — the field means nothing

/** What an `attachFromDeck` op is offering: the deck-wide matches for its filter

    **The collapse is the difference from `attachFromTopOffer`.** That one reads a
    window of `n` cards, so its candidate list is small by construction; this one
    reads the WHOLE deck, where a real list holds a dozen Basic {R} Energy. Twelve
    rows for a pick of three is one question wearing twelve hats, so the offer
    keeps at most `max` representatives per interchangeable class — the D42 rule
    the mandatory discards run on (`interchangeableCandidates`), with the same cap
    logic and for the same reason: a pick can never want more than `max` copies of
    one class, and the copies that survive are still interchangeable with each
    other, so every DISTINGUISHABLE answer remains reachable. Keying is
    `cardIdentity`, which reads a Basic Energy by what it PROVIDES — the catalog
    prints the same Basic Fire Energy under four ids (sve-002/-010/-018 plus
    sv03-230 "Basic Fire Energy", which `energyProvidesOf` reads identically), and
    an id key would offer
    them as three separate answers.

    There is no host to key on here (these cards are in a pile, attached to
    nothing), which is exactly why the discard collapse's `refKeyOf(from)` prefix
    is absent: WHICH Pokémon loses an Energy is always a real choice, but which of
    three identical Energy comes out of the deck never is.

    **THE CAP IS THE BOARD'S AS WELL AS THE PRINT'S**, for `attachFromTop`'s
    reason — "a prompt reading `max: 3` over a single row invites a pick that does
    not exist" — and this op has a SECOND way to be short. Three ceilings, and the
    real one is their minimum:
      • the printed `max` ("up to 2");
      • how many cards are actually there (the clamp attachFromTop already takes);
      • **`targets.length × maxPerTarget`**, which is the one a per-target rule
        introduces. Janine on the ordinary board — one {D} Pokémon — prints "up to
        2" and can legally attach exactly ONE, so a prompt saying 2 would have the
        dialog count "0/2" over a board where 1 is the ceiling, and invite a
        second pick the validator then refuses. Without a per-target rule this
        ceiling does not exist (one Pokémon can take every card), which is why it
        reads as `op.max` when the rider is absent rather than as `targets.length`.
      • 🆕 **`oneTarget` ADDS NO FOURTH CEILING, AND THAT IS THE ASYMMETRY WORTH
        STATING** (D457). Its sibling caps cards PER target, so a short target list
        shortens the pick; this one caps TARGETS, and one target may take every
        card in the batch — *"attach them to 1 of your Pokémon"* on a one-Pokémon
        board still attaches two. The board term is `targets.length >= 1`, which
        the empty-target dead end above already answers, so the arithmetic here is
        deliberately unmoved. A `Math.min(op.max, 1)` here would be the mistake
        this bullet exists to name: it would offer ONE card off a card that prints
        two.

    The board ceiling is taken BEFORE the collapse and the collapse runs at that
    cap, so the offer holds no representative the pick could not use: a pick that
    can only want one card is shown one row. The candidate clamp is then taken
    after, so it counts offered rows.

    runs, and is deliberately NOT a `programPlayable` input (see the op's doc). */

/** ⚠️⚠️ D247 — What an `attachFromHand` op is offering: the controller's own HAND
    cards its filter admits (hand order), the eligible targets, and the cap.

    **THE CAP IS ALWAYS THE CANDIDATE SET, because every sentence this op reads
    prints "any number"** — there is no `max` on the op to clamp against (see its
    doc). That is also why this offer runs NO interchangeable collapse, unlike
    `attachFromDeckOffer` one function up, and the reason is arithmetic rather
    than taste: that collapse keeps at most `max` representatives per class, and
    with `max === candidates.length` the test `already >= cap` can never fire, so
    a collapse here would be an inert copy of a rule. It would also be wrong in
    spirit — the hand is a zone its owner already sees card by card, where the
    deck is not, so hiding a duplicate row would hide a card the player is
    looking at.

    ⚠️ THE RIDERS ARGUMENT IS THE EMPTY OBJECT, AND THAT IS THE PRINT SPEAKING
    RATHER THAN A SHORTCUT. Every sentence this op reads prints the bare *"to your
    Pokémon"*, so the op declares no target rider (D135 — a field with no printing
    behind it is a branch no test can witness) and the argument has nothing to
    carry. What is shared is still the RULE: the un-narrowed target set comes from
    `attachEnergyTargets` exactly as the other three attach ops' narrowed ones do,
    so the fourth op cannot come to disagree about who may receive an attach. The
    day a printing spells "your Benched {W} Pokémon", the op gains the field and
    this call site passes it — the same one-line change `attachFromDeck` made.

    NOTE — this reads the HAND, which is why it is the one offer in this family

    Art): move each assigned card out of the deck onto the Pokémon it was assigned
    to, and hand back the uids that ACTUALLY moved (§9.2 — the record).

    **`validateChoice` is the ONE gate** on what may be attached — the cap, the
    per-target cap, that every uid was offered, that no uid appears twice, and
    that every destination is an offered target. This function re-derives none of
    it, for `attachFromTopApply`'s reason: two readers of one rule drift. What it
    does carry is the same wire-safety every mover in this file carries — the DECK
    is re-read live and only uids actually sitting in it move, so a stale uid, a
    repeated one, or a target that is not on the board is SKIPPED rather than
    conjured. Dropping the bench-index check would silently DESTROY a card: the
    `bench.map` no-ops, the event fires, and the uid still leaves the deck.

    Each attach emits its own ENERGY_ATTACHED — the card lands face up on the
    board, so nothing else has to announce it, and in particular there is no
    "searched" event: what a search *found* is the controller's private business
    (they saw their own deck), and what it *took* is public through this. The
    target rides the event REBUILT field by field, never spread off the client's
    ref (the §2 copy contract).

    The deck keeps its order minus the taken cards; the trailing `shuffleDeck` op
    is what scrambles it, so a search that takes nothing still leaves the printed
    shuffle to the op that prints it. Never damages, so it never KOs and never
    touches the flow tail.

    Takes no `op`, unlike its from-the-top twin: with the cap, the filter, the
    window and the leftovers all belonging to somebody else, the assignments and
    the live source zone are the whole input.

    ⚠️⚠️ D247 — **`zone` IS THE ONLY THING THAT SEPARATES THE DECK SEARCH FROM THE
    HAND ATTACH, SO IT IS A PARAMETER AND NOT A SECOND COPY OF THIS FUNCTION.**
    `attachFromHand` (Alolan Exeggutor ex "Tropical Frenzy") moves cards out of
    the controller's HAND onto the same targets under the same wire-safety rules;
    a duplicated mover is exactly the "two readers of one rule drift" defect this
    file refuses one paragraph up, and the two would have drifted first on the
    membership re-read — the one line that keeps a stale uid from being conjured
    onto the board. The zone names a `PlayerSide` key, so the re-read, the removal

    energy, emitting one ENERGY_ATTACHED each (each host resolves by its own
    energy uid, robust to any same-batch move). This is not the §6.3 one-per-turn
    manual attach — no allowance is touched; it is the Ability's own effect. The
    `bonusCounters` rider then puts that many HP of damage counters on the same
    Pokémon (Gardevoir's 2) — always non-lethal, because attachEnergyTargets
    already excluded would-be-KO'd targets (notIfKO), so this op never KOs and
    never touches the flow tail.

    ⚠️ `count` ATTACHES TO THE ONE `ref` AND NEVER RE-ASKS (D205). That is the
    entire difference from the older model of "N of these ops in a program",
    which parks N times and may land on N different bodies: Ethan's Ho-Oh ex
    "Golden Flame" prints *"attach up to 2 … to **1 of** your Benched Ethan's
    Pokémon"*, and a split across two bodies is a rule the card does not print.
    Fewer than `count` matching Energy attaches what there is, silently — the
    printed "up to", and the same shortfall the sequential model produced when a
    later op found nothing left.

    ⚠️ `bonusCounters` FIRES ONCE PER OP, NOT ONCE PER CARD, and the two riders
    do not co-occur on any printing in the catalog (asserted in the slice suite,
    not assumed here). Once-per-op is the reading that leaves every pre-D205
    program byte-identical, which is the only one this change is entitled to
    make; a printing that combines them would owe its own argument.

    ⚠️ `healTarget` (D236) is `bonusCounters`' MIRROR and follows every one of its
    rules — same body, same once-per-op, same "the op that knows the ref does the
    work". It is applied LAST, after the attach is written, so what it heals is
    the board this call produced. */

/** Apply a from-the-top attach (Electric Generator / Hydreigon "Tri Howl"): move
    each assigned card off the deck TOP onto the Pokémon it was assigned to, then
    settle the leftovers clause.

    **`validateChoice` is the ONE gate** on what may be attached: it alone
    enforces the cap, that every uid was offered (so the filter and the window
    boundary hold), that no uid appears twice, and that every destination is an
    offered target. This function re-derives nothing — duplicating those rules
    here would be two readers that can drift, which is the shape this codebase
    keeps collapsing. What it does carry is wire-safety of the same kind
    searchMove / moveEnergyApply carry: the looked-at WINDOW is re-read off the
    live deck and only uids actually sitting in it move, so a stale uid, a
    repeated one, or a target that is not there is SKIPPED rather than conjured —
    a card is never duplicated, and never lands in neither zone (drop the
    bench-index check and an out-of-range target silently deletes a card: the
    `bench.map` no-ops, the event fires, and the uid still leaves the deck). Each
    attach emits its own ENERGY_ATTACHED, the same event the hand/discard attach
    uses: the card lands face up on the board, so nothing else has to announce it.
    The target rides the event REBUILT field by field, never spread off the
    client's ref (the §2 copy contract — see moveEnergyApply).

    The leftovers run LAST and on EVERY path, including the empty ones stepOp
    routes here: `restTo` (Hydreigon's "Discard the other cards"; Metang's "Shuffle
    the other cards and put them on the bottom of your deck") is a cost the card
    charges whether or not the look found anything to attach, and one apply is what
    keeps a branch from skipping it. `restTo` absent (Electric Generator) leaves the
    unattached cards exactly where they are — still on top of the deck, for the
    trailing `shuffleDeck` op to scramble.

    🆕🆕 **D352 — TWO DESTINATIONS, ONE OF THEM AN EVENT AND ONE OF THEM NOT**, and
    the fork is `revealFromTop`'s transferred verbatim rather than re-derived: that
    is precisely what `attachFromTop`'s own doc meant when it priced this widening
    at "the field and nothing else, because the apply below is shared in shape".
    ⚠️ **THE LEFTOVERS ARE `window \ attached`, NOT `candidates \ attached`** — the
    printed "other cards" are every card the player LOOKED AT and did not take,
    including the ones the filter never admitted. That was already true of the
    discard arm; it is stated here because under `"shuffledBottom"` a card the
    filter refused is put back UNDER the deck rather than into the pile, and the
    difference is visible to a player counting their deck.

    is no host and this key is the whole story).

    A **Basic** Energy has no identity beyond the type it provides: the
    catalog prints the very same Basic Fire Energy under several ids (sve-002 /
    sve-010 / sve-018, identical in every field that matters), so keying on the id
    would treat three interchangeable Fire Energy in one real deck as three
    separate answers. This is exactly the fungibility `attachEnergyFrom` already
    asserts ("same-type Basic Energy is fungible, so the only decision is the
    TARGET"), read from the other end.

    Everything else keys on the catalog **id**: two Special Energy prints carry
    different rules text, so only two copies of the SAME print are interchangeable.
    The `basic:` / `card:` prefixes keep the two spaces apart, so a Basic Fire and
    a Special Energy that happens to provide {R} never collapse into each other.
    A uid with no catalog card gets a key of its own — park and ask rather than
    guess. (Unreachable today: `attachedEnergies` filters through
    `matchesAttached`, whose card-only arm rejects an unresolvable card and whose
    `providesEnergy` arm reads that card's provision, so no such uid can enter the
    candidate list. Kept because the fallback costs nothing and the alternative is

    identical card in the identical owner's discard pile, so offering both is one
    question wearing two hats. WHICH POKÉMON loses the Energy is ALWAYS a real
    choice, so the key includes the host: two identical Basic Energy on two
    different Pokémon stay two candidates.

    `cap` is how many the pick could possibly want from one class — 1 for the
    single-Energy arms, N for an exact-N discard. Keeping N rather than 1 is what
    makes "Discard 3 Energy" off three identical {F} + one {W} answerable at all
    (collapsing to one {F} would leave two candidates for a three-card pick); the

/** What a `moveEnergy` op can take, where it can put it, and how many
    destinations that route needs to be worth asking about — ONE rule with two
    readers (the op's own no-op test and the `programPlayable` gate above), for
    the same reason the filter reads provision through one helper: the play gate
    and the play itself disagreeing is how a card becomes playable and then does
    nothing, or is refused while a legal move existed.

    The free route (Energy Switch / Poppy) takes from anywhere and needs TWO
    Pokémon in play, because the source is also a candidate destination and a
    Pokémon may not move Energy onto itself. `benchToActive` (Armarouge) takes
    from the bench alone and its sole destination is the Active, so source and
    destination are disjoint by construction and ONE destination is enough — a
    bench source already had to exist for `movable` to be non-empty.

    A vacant Active makes `destinations` empty and the route a no-op. That state
    is not reachable through the action API today (the Active spot is only empty
    during a `ko:promote` park, where `turnGate` refuses `useAbility` and
    `playTrainer` outright), which is why it is asserted here rather than tested
    from a board — but it is asserted in exactly one place now, so it cannot rot
    in two of three copies.

    `koedActiveToToolHolder` (D171, Exp. Share sv01-174) is the MIRROR of
    `benchToActive` and the first route to pin its destination by UID: sources are
    the ACTIVE alone (the body being Knocked Out — "from that Pokémon"), and the
    sole destination is whichever in-play Pokémon carries `sourceUid`, which for a
    Tool-borne program is the TOOL's own uid ("the Pokémon this card is attached
    to"). ONE destination is enough for the same reason it is on `benchToActive` —
    source and destination are disjoint by construction, here because the holder is
    explicitly excluded from being the Active. `sourceUid` is threaded rather than
    read off `ctx` because `moveEnergyPlayable` (the programPlayable gate) has no
    context: it passes none, this route then offers no destination, and a top-level
    Trainer authored with it is refused as a would-only-whiff play — which is
    correct, since the route is only ever reachable from a Tool's on-KO trigger.

    `selfToBench` (D229, 13 legal ATTACK printings) is `benchToActive` READ
    BACKWARDS: sources are the attacker, destinations are that seat's whole Bench.
    ONE destination is enough for `benchToActive`'s reason mirrored — source and
    destination are disjoint by construction, here because the Active is not on the
    Bench — and an EMPTY Bench makes `destinations` empty and the route a no-op,
    which is a reachable board (unlike the vacant Active two paragraphs up) and is
    driven rather than asserted.

    ⚠️ ITS SOURCE IS THE **ACTIVE** AND NOT `sourceRef`, WHICH IS A CLAIM ABOUT
    THE PRINTINGS. All 13 are attack text and §8 lets only the Active attack, so
    the two answers coincide on every board this route can reach; resolving the
    printed "this Pokémon" through `ctx.sourceUid` would add a distinction no test
    could ever kill. Stated in the op's own doc too, with the condition that would
    change it (a benched body's Ability printing the sentence).

    🆕🆕 **D443 — `seat` IS THE BOARD, NOT THE CONTROLLER, AND THAT IS A RENAME OF
    THE CONTRACT RATHER THAN A CHANGE TO ONE LINE OF THE BODY.** Every route below
    already reads its endpoints off whatever seat it is handed — `attachedEnergies`,
    `ownInPlayRefs` and the bench map are all pure functions of it — so the widening
    is entirely at the two CALL SITES, which now pass `moveBoardSeat(op, ctx.seat)`.
    Nothing here branches on `side`, and that is deliberate on two counts: the
    endpoint rules are identical on either board (a Pokémon still may not move Energy
    onto itself; the free route still needs two bodies; `selfToBench` still runs
    Active → Bench), and keeping the branch out of this function is what lets the
    `programPlayable` gate and the park share one answer about a question that now
    has two possible boards.

    ⚠️ **THE TWO UID-ANCHORED ROUTES THEREFORE WHIFF ON THE OTHER BOARD, AND THAT IS
    THE SAFE DIRECTION.** `koedActiveToToolHolder` looks for `sourceUid` among
    `seat`'s Tools and `othersToSelf` resolves `sourceRef` on `seat` — the card
    running the program is always on the CONTROLLER's board, so on the opponent's it
    is not found, `destinations` is empty and the op is a no-op. The alternative —
    anchoring those ends on the controller while the other end crosses — would build
    a move from one board onto the other, which no printing spells and which the
    apply's own `dest.seat !== board` guard would then have to admit. No printed card
    combines `side` with either route; the whiff is recorded rather than blocked,
    exactly as this op's other representable-but-unprinted combinations are.

    ⚠️ **AND THE §11 SHIELD IS NOT ASKED HERE.** It is a FILTER at the `stepOp` arm
    (D259's placement rule), outside this funnel, because `unshieldedRefs` announces
    its refusals and needs `ctx`/`events` — which the `programPlayable` reader has
    neither of and must not emit. `gustTargets` states the identical division. */

    reason `gustTargets` is: `programPlayable` (cardplay.ts) must refuse on
    EXACTLY the set `stepOp` would offer, or the grey-out and the offer disagree.

    🛑 **AND THEY DID DISAGREE.** `programPlayable`'s arm read
    `players[opponent].bench.length === 0` for EVERY `damageChosen`, which is the
    `opponentBench` reading and only that one. It was accidentally right for four
    slices' worth of rows because every registry producer was a Bench snipe
    (Hawlucha, Meowscarada ex, Radiant Blastoise) and every `opponentAny` producer
    was an ATTACK — and attacks never consult `programPlayable` (§8). The first
    registry `opponentAny` row (D345's "Cursed Blast") is the board where an
    opponent with a bare Active greyed out an Ability whose own op offers that
    Active as a candidate. **A GATE THAT RE-IMPLEMENTS ITS OP'S PREDICATE IS RIGHT
    UNTIL THE OP GROWS AN ARM**, which is the argument the `gust` line beside it
    already makes in words.

    🆕🆕 **D437 — AND THE PRINTED PER-BODY NARROWING GOES HERE, WHICH IS THE WHOLE
    OF THAT SLICE'S PLACEMENT DECISION.** *"…to 1 of your opponent's Benched Pokémon
    **that has any damage counters on it**."* — `op.damagedOnly`. Three things follow
    from narrowing at the funnel rather than at the op, and each is a case a careless
    build gets wrong:

      • **A FILTERED SET CAN BE EMPTY WHERE THE UNFILTERED ONE WAS NOT.** An opponent
        with three UNDAMAGED benched bodies offers three candidates unfiltered and
        ZERO filtered, and the op's own `candidates.length === 0` arm turns that into
        the silent no-op every snipe already takes on an empty Bench — no prompt, no
        event, and NOT an `ATTACK_EFFECT_SKIPPED`, because the sentence was read.
      • **A FILTERED SET OF EXACTLY ONE IS FORCED**, where the unfiltered board would
        have parked. `stepOp`'s `!declinable && candidates.length <= op.count` arm is
        the M1 no-choice rule, and it must read the NARROWED count: one damaged body
        beside two undamaged ones is not a decision.
      • **THE SHIELD IS ASKED AFTER THE NARROWING, NOT BEFORE** (D433). Every §11-ish
        prevention this op consults — `benchShieldedFromDamage`, the six
        `targetPassives.prevent*` disjuncts, `attackDamageBlocked`,
        `coinFlipShieldPrevents` — lives INSIDE `placeSnipe`'s loop over the refs it
        is handed, so a body this narrowing removed is never asked about and cannot
        file a `DAMAGE_DEALT{prevented}` row for a hit that was never coming.
        Narrowing here is what makes that true; narrowing later would reproduce
        D433's false log row exactly.

    ⚠️ **AND IT IS APPLIED TO WHICHEVER SCOPE `target` NAMES**, not to the Bench by
    hand. No printing spells the narrowing against `opponentAny` today; spelling the
    Bench twice would be the second enumeration of one noun this funnel exists to

    both a predicate and a string owes both arms — telling a player "up to 2 cards"
    over a sentence that gives them no choice about the 2 is the engine authoring

/** 🆕 D343 — WHICH CARDS a `reorderTop` is ordering, spelled once for
    `reorderTopOwner`'s reason exactly: the park offers this window and the apply
    must splice back over the same one, and two reductions each doing their own
    arithmetic is how they come to disagree.

    **BOTH ARMS RETURN THE WINDOW IN DECK ORDER**, so index 0 is always the card
    nearer the TOP — even on the bottom fork, where the last element is the very
    bottom of the deck. That is what lets ONE `orderCards` prompt, one validator
    and one dialog serve both ends: the answer means "this sequence, read from the
    top down", and only the splice knows where it lands.

    ⚠️ **THE OUTER CLAMP ON THE BOTTOM ARM IS DOCUMENTATION, NOT BEHAVIOUR, AND
    THAT WAS MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED.** The obvious story — "a deck shorter
    than `op.n` makes `deck.length - n` negative, and a negative `slice` start
    counts from the END" — is the story D343 wrote first and then killed with a
    mutant (`D343-reorder-window-bottom-is-off-by-the-window`, a DECLARED
    EQUIVALENT). ECMA-262 clamps a `slice` start below `-length` to 0, so
    `deck.slice(-5)` and `deck.slice(Math.max(0, deck.length - 5))` are the same
    expression on a short deck and identical on a long one. **NO BOARD SEPARATES
    THEM**, so no suite can kill it and none should be written trying. It stays
    because it makes the two arms read as mirror images — both floored at 0 —
    which is worth one token; it is not a guard against anything. The top arm's
    `Math.max(0, op.n)` is the same kind of statement about a negative `n`. */

/** 🆕 D341 — the `orderCards` caption. Speaks to the ANSWERER, like every note in
    this file, and names WHOSE deck because on three of the four printings it is
    not theirs — the one fact a player looking at four face-down backs cannot get
    from the dialog itself.

    ⚠️ THE PRINTED NUMBER IS **NOT** SPELLED, and that is `lookNote`'s own lesson
    (D333/D334) pointed the other way. `op.n` is the printed WINDOW, and the cards
    actually on offer are `min(n, deck.length)` — so a caption reading "the top 5"
    over a 2-card deck would print a number contradicted by the dialog beside it.
    Every other caption in this file names a number the player is choosing ABOUT;
    here the count is not a decision at all (see the prompt's doc: no `min`, no
    `max`), so there is nothing for a number to be a claim about.

    🆕 **D343 — THE BOTTOM FORK GETS ITS OWN SENTENCE, AND THE VERB CHANGES WITH
    IT.** The top arms say *"Put these cards **back**"* because the print does:
    the player looked at cards that were already there and is returning them. Kofu
    never looked at anything — the two cards came out of the controller's own hand
    a moment ago — so *"back"* would assert a return that did not happen, and the
    caption says *"on the bottom of your deck"* with the printed verb instead. The
    same distinction `exact` drew for `lookNote`: a caption is a claim, and the
    one word that is wrong is the whole cost.

    ⚠️ **THERE IS NO OPPONENT × BOTTOM ARM AND ITS ABSENCE IS DELIBERATE (D135).**
    No printed sentence orders the bottom of a deck its player does not own, so a
    fourth string would be a caption no board can reach. `side` is checked first,
    which means an author who paired the two forks would get the opponent's
    top-deck sentence over a bottom-deck window — wrong, and unreachable, and
